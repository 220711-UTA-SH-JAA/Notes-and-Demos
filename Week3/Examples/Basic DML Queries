/* Data Manipulation Language
	- Used to change the data inside of the database/table
	- Often referred to as the CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
		- This is theoretical minimum operations you need for you tables
	- Syntax/Keywords for DML
		- INSERT: used to add data to our table aka CREATE
		- SELECT: used to retrieve data from our table aka READ
		- UPDATE: used to update data in our table
		- DELETE: used to delted data from our table
	
	Data Query Language
	- This sub-language is often debated, however it exists in Postgres
	- The debate itself is that should it be its language or part of DML
	- Syntax/Keywords
		- SELECT: specifically paired with the WHERE keyword to specific specific records
*/

/* Most basic DML creating table entries with INSERT */

insert into groceries (customer_name, email, password, item_name, item_type, item_price) values
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan@email.com', 'password', 'hot dogs', 'meat', 2.99);
	
/* insert multiple entries at once */
insert into groceries (customer_name, email, password, item_name, item_type, item_price) values
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan2@email.com', 'password', 'buns', 'bread', 1.99),
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan3@email.com', 'password', 'ketchup', 'sauce', 1.99),
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan4@email.com', 'password', 'mustard', 'sauce', 1.99),
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan5@email.com', 'password', 'chips', 'snack', 3.99),
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan6@email.com', 'password', 'chip dip', 'sauce', 1.99),
	('Ethan McGill', 'ethan7@email.com', 'password', 'brews', 'drink', 12.99);
	
/* Very basic DML SELECT statement */
-- Selects all data from the table
SELECT * FROM groceries;

-- Deletes all the data from the table with the DELETE keyword from DML
DELETE * FROM groceries;

/* UPDATING will come after lunch after we look at DQL queries */

/* Some other notible keywords you may see when querying a database are:
 * - WHERE: used to narrow down the results of the query
 * - ORDER BY: used to sort/order data by a specific column
 * - GROUP BY: used in conjunction with aggregate functions
 * - HAVING: similar to WHERE but also typically used with aggregate functions
 */

insert into groceries (customer_name, email, password, item_name, item_type, item_price) values
	('Pablo', 'pablo@email1.com', 'password', 'gummy worms', 'candy', 1.99),
	('Erika', 'erika@email1.com', 'password', 'pepsi', 'drink', 2.50),
	('Gordon', 'gordon@email1.com', 'password', 'coke', 'drink', 2.50);

SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE customer_name = 'Ethan McGill';

SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE customer_name != 'Ethan McGill';

SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE customer_name = 'Ethan McGill' AND item_type = 'sauce';

/* The LIKE keyword can be used with wildcards to match things that are similar
 *  '%' wildcard will match 0 or more chacters
 *  '_' wildcard will match exactly one character
 */

SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE customer_name LIKE 'E%';

/* Order the price of the drinks from lowest to highest */
SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE item_type = 'drink' ORDER BY item_price;

/* Order the price of the drinkes are highest to lowest */
SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE item_type = 'drink' ORDER BY item_price DESC;

/* Aliases: allows you to give a column or table a temporary name when querying
	- These are often used to make the column names of result sets easier to read
	- We can use the as keyword to specify a alias
*/

-- You don't have to select the entire table, you can choose to select specific columns instead
SELECT item_name AS Drink, item_price as Price
FROM groceries 
WHERE item_type = 'drink'
ORDER BY item_price DESC;

/* Update specific columns with the UPDATE keyword */
/* Typically what you will see with update, is that you will specify to update a specific item by its id */
UPDATE groceries SET item_price = '3.99' WHERE item_name = 'hot dogs';


/* Delete specific rows from the table with the DELETE keyword */
DELETE from groceries WHERE item_price > 4.99;
