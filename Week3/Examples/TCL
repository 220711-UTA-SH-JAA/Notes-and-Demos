/*	Transaction Control Language
	- Used to manage transaction within a database
	- Transaction: is a set of changes made to the database
	- Syntax/Keywords for TCL:
		- COMMIT: this will perminently save and DML operations that occured
		- ROLLBACK: will go back to a previous save point, disgarding any DML operations
			- You can only ROLLBACK before you make a COMMIT
		- SAVEPOINT: this create a point to roll back to if something goes wrong

	Propertiers of a transaction in SQL
	- In SQL every transaction must follow these four rules/properties

	Atomic: All or nothing, the transaction must fully complete or nothing happens at all

	Consistency: The tables and schema shall remain intact after the transaction

	Isolation: Each transaction shall not interfer with one another

	Durability: Data will persist through system crashes and other issues

	These create the ACID properties, be ready to be asked about these in interviews
