/* 	Indexes: used to speed up the look up of rows in a database
	- created on individual table columns which you expect to look up often
	- primary keys a automatically given indexes

	When an index is created on a database column, a separate data structure is created in the database, typically
		some type of balanced tree which stores references to the actual records in the table

	Speeds up retrieval, at the cost of speed to insert into the table

	Only create an index/extra indexes, when you anticipate that you will be searching for a specific column
		very often

	Types of indexes:
	There are many types of indexes, however they are split into 2 main categories
	- Clustered
	- Non-clustered

	Clustered Indexes: alter the order in which the records are physically stoed on the disk, only one of these
		are allowed per table

	Non-clustered Indexes: specify a logical ordering of rows, but not alter the physical ordering of the table
		Multiple per table are allowed

	Different indexes:
	- Bitmap
	- Dense
	- Sparse
	- Reverse
	- Primary
	- Secondary

	The simple syntax CREATE INDEX ON table_name (column)
