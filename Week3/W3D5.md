# PL/SQL (Procedural Language SQL):
allows us to create functions and other reusable bits of sql directly in our database
- It will make our sql closer to a programming language

# Functions vs Stored Procedures

## Stored Procedures

Reusable code in PL/SQL that have these properties
- Don't return anything
- May or may not contain IN and OUT parameters
- They allow any DML statement within
- Can call other stored procedures
- Cannot use them IN DML statements


## Functions

Reusable code in PL/SQL that returns a value and has these properties
- Allows cursors
- Should return a single value
- They may or may not contain IN parameters
- Only SELECT statements are allowed
- Can call other functions
- Can be used WITH any other DML
- You have to use a DML enable to call a function

# Callable Statements

an interface used to execute stored procedures from our database

To get access to a callable statement you must call the prepareCall method on the connection object

When you prepare the call you must pass in the procedure you would like to call in the prepareCall method

You can access the ResultSet similarily to how you access it with the other two Statement interfaces
