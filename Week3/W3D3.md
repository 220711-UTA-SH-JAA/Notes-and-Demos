# Joins

Joins are used to connect and gain information from multiple tables at the same time. Tables are connect to each other using what is known as a join predicate.
There are different types of joins:

-   `(INNER) JOIN`

    -   Used to return the values that only exist in both tables queried

-   `LEFT JOIN`

    -   Returns ALL the values in the first/left table and only the matching values in the second/right table

-   `RIGHT JOIN`

    -   The opposite of a left join
    -   Returns ALL the values in the right/second table and only the matching values in the first/left table

-   `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`

    -   Combination of a left join and a right join
    -   Returns all of the results in both tables regardless of whether or not they have a matching value in the other table

-   `SELF JOIN`
    - An INNER JOIN performed matching two columns existing in the same table.
    - They represent hierarchies

-   `CROSS JOIN`
    - Returns the cartesian product two or more tables

-   General syntax:

```sql
SELECT [columns]
FROM [left table]
LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN [right table]
ON [join predicate];
```

-   `NATURAL`

    -   Natural is a keyword used in addition to a join declaration.
    -   Natural removes the need for a join predicate and simply joins the tables by the same column names

-   Natural Join Syntax:

```sql
SELECT [columns]
FROM [left table]
NATURAL LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN [right table]
```

Subqueries are essentially queries held within another query

-   Useful for combining queries together to minimize change required by developer or analyst
-   Can go anywhere in the `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses
-   Must be contained entirely within parantheses
-   If used with a `WHERE` clause it must be aliased
-   Can be used with DML commands (`INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)

# Set Operations

Set operations aggregate data together in ways different than joins

-   Used to combine multiple columns worth of data together at once for comparison
-   Sets being operated on need to have the same number of columns selected and those columns must contain similar data types
-   Set operations are done using the `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` commands
    -   `UNION`
        -   Combines columns of data vertically. Takes all the data from the first select and combines it with all the data from the second select without duplicates
    -   `UNION ALL`
        -   Very similar to `UNION`. The only difference is that `UNION ALL` includes duplicates.
    -   `INTERSECT`
        -   Contains the intersection of the two selects. It will only return a column with values that both selects share.
    -   `EXCEPT`
        -   Sometimes called `MINUS` in other versions of SQL
        -   Returns the data from the first select and removes any columns that are also in the other selection
        -   Another way to this about this is the first select minus the intersection it has with the second selection

# Difference between JOIN and UNION

Joins and Unions may seem very similar but they are different in one cardinal way

-   Joins combine data "horizontally". When two tables are joined together the data is compiled so that columns are placed next to each other in a horizontal fashion
-   Unions combine data "vertically". When you union two selections the result sets are stacked vertically into the same number of columns as the selects. If you have one column for the selects it'll take the results from the first query and "stack" them on top of the results from the second query.

# Scalar Functions

Are functions in Postgres/almost any sql which take in a single col at a time, and operate on it

These can be used with SELECT and WHERE

- LENGTH(string(varchar)) return the length of the string
- UPPER(varchar) return the string in all upper case
- LOWER(varchar) return the string in all lower case
- ABS(number) returns the absolute value of the number
- CEILING returns the number rounded up
- FLOOR(num) returns the number rounded down

# Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions take in mulitple rows, and combines the values into a single column

- MAX(column) return the max value of all the columns from the selected rows
- MIN(column) return the min value of all the columns from the selected rows
- AVG(column) return the average value of all the columns from the selected rows
- SUM(column) return the sum of the values of the columns from the selected rows
- COUNT(column) returns the total number of elements in that column

These functions are used in the SELECT clause, and cannot be used with the WHERE clause

If more than one column is being selected in the SELECT clause and you are using an aggregate function, you must use GROUP BY keyword

You can also use the HAVING keyword clause with an aggregate function instead of a WHERE

# Indexes

Indexes are used to speed up the look up of rows in a database
- created on individual table columns which you expect to look up often
- primary keys are automatically given indexes

When an index is created on a data base column, a separate data structure is created in the database, typically some type of balanced tree which stores references to the actuals records in the table

Speeds up retrieval time, but lose effiency when inserting into the table

Only create an index/extra indexes, when you anticipate heavy searching for a particular column

## Types of Indexes

There are many types of indexes, however they are split up into two categories: clustered and non-clustered

Clustered indexes: alter the order in which the records are physically stored on the disk. Only one of the indexes can be created per table

Non-clustered indexes: specify a logical ordering of rows, but not not alter the physical ordering of the table. There may be more than one of these per table

Different index types:
- Bitmap
- Dense
- Sparse
- Reverse
- Primary
- Secondary

## Creating an index

Use the syntax: `CREATE INDEX ON table_name (column_name)`
