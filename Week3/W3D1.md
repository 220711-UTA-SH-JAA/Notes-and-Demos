# Amazon Web Services Intro (AWS):
Cloud computing services that are provided by Amazon
- providing a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and more

## Advantages of Cloud Computing:
- Pay as you go, aka
- Lower pay as you go prices due to economies of scale
- Automatically scale up or down
- Easily and quickly alocate resources
- Less startup cost (no needs to buy server equipment)
- Deploy your application globally in seconds

## Cloud Computing Models

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- a self-service model for managing remote data center infrastructures

Platform as a Service (PaaS):
- allows organizations to build, run and manage applications without IT infrastructure

Software as a Service (SaaS):
- replaces traditional on-device software with software that is licensed on a subscription basis

AWS follows pay as you go, with the free tier options

AWS is also available in over 24 regions, with 77 Availibilty zones

## AWS region:
geographic location with a collection of availability zones

## Availability Zone:
A physical data center inside of a region

# AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):
a service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud.
- cost-efficient, resizable capacity for industry standard relational databases
- manages database administration tasks

# SQL Overview

## Database:
A collection of structured data, typically grouped into tables
-   Each table has rows and columns
    -   The row will hold the information about the particular entry
    -   The columns are are attributes of the items in the table

## Primary key:
Unique identifier for each entry in a table
-   Each row will have only one primary key, but a primary key can consist of multiple columns (composite key)

## DBMS and RDBMS

DBMS: Database Management System
-   These are what we use to store and manage the data in our databases
-   The ultimate goal of a Database is to persist information

RDBMS: Relational Database Management System
-   This is what we will be using during training
-   Relational Databases are used to store information in tables that have relations with one another
-   RDBMS's are structured so that it maintains the security, accuracy, integrity, and consistency of data

## SQL: Structured Query Language

Underlying Language used to query relational databases
- Not a programming langauge
- Has an English like syntax

# Database Vendors

There are many different RDBMS vendors / flavors of SQL, these include:
- Oracle
- PostregreSQL
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQLServer
- Microsoft Access

# Datatypes

Tables in our databases have attributes that describe the data stored in the row, these attributes can be of many different datatypes. 

Common datatypes include:

-   boolean (bool): evaulates to true or false
-   chararacter (`char[n]`) : a fixed length character string
-   character varying (`varchar[n]`) : a varying length string of characters
-   date : a calendar date
-   integer (int): a whole number
-   numeric/decimal: a decimal number

## Defining Schema:

A database schema refers to the formal sctructure of data defined by a relational database:
- the various tables with theirs columns and data types
- the relationships between the tables in the database

Schemas also enforce constraints when defining tabales, so we can visualize them using Entity Relationship Diagrams

# Reading an ERD

Entity Relationship Diagram, its going to illistrate out tables relate to one another

We have three main components of an ERD

Entity:
- What is the table representing

Attributes:
- What are the columns of the table

Relationships:
- How are these tables related/connected

## Constraints

Are restrictions that we can put on the columns of our tables in SQL

This is esentially how we are capable of enforcing/creating the schema of the database

Some constraints include:
- Composite Key: a key that uses more than on column
- Not null: the column must have data
- Unique: no two records entered into the table can have the same data in this column
- Primary Key: denotes the column as the primary key
- Foreign Key: denotes that the column references a column of a different table
- Default: create a default value if one is not specified
- Serial: an old way of auto generating a primary key
- Identity: a newer way of auto generating a priary key

Every table needs a Primary Key column
- The primary key is unique and not null implicitly
