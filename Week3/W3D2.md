# SQL Sublanguages

There are 5 sublanguages in SQL

DDL, DML, DCL, DQL, TCL

## Data Definition Language (DDL):

Used to define the database itself
- Deal with the creation, alteration or deletion of tables, schemas, or databases
- Syntax/Keywords for DDL:
    - CREATE: used to create a table, schema, or database
    - ALTER: used to make changes on a table, schema or database
    - DROP: used completely remove a table
    - TRUNCATE: used to remove the data from a table, but keep the structure intacts

## Data Control Language (DCL):
Used to manage the security and control over our databases
- Syntax/Keywords
    - GRANT: grant access/permissions
    - REVOKE: revoke access/permissions

## Data Manipulation Language

Used to change data inside of the database/table
- Often refered to as the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - This is the theoretical construct of the mininum you should be able to do with a table in SQL
- Syntax/Keywords for DML:
    - INSERT: add data into the table
    - SELECT: retrieve data from the table
    - UPDATE: used to update data in the table
    - DELETE: useed to remove data from the table

## Data Query Language (DQL):

This one is often debated, however it exists in Postgres so we cover it
- The debate itself is if it should be its own sub-language, or just part of DML
- Syntax/Keywords for DQL:
    - SELECT:
    - Typically it is talking about SELECT that is being used with other keywords to specify exact results

## Other notible keywords used with DQL

WHERE: used to narrow down the query results of your select statement

ORDER BY: used to sort data returned by the select statement by a specific row

GROUP BY: used to group rows by a column, typically used with aggregate functions

HAVING: similar to where clause, but used in conjunction with an aggregate function

## Aliases

In SQL you can give a table or column in a table a temporary name with an alias

These are often used to make column names of result sets more readible, and often used in joins to help identify what you are joining

To give a column or table an alias you use the `as` keyword


# Normalization

Refers to reducing redundancy of data, and improving data integrity and consistency

We focus on the first three forms of normalization

## First Normal Form

Must have a primary key

No duplicate values in rows

Atomic Columns (break up columns as small as possible)

## Second Normal Form

Must be first normal form

All attributes must depend of the primary

## Third Normal Form

Must be second normal form

There are no transisitive dependencies, data should only relate to the primary, not some other column in the table

### The key (1NF), the whole key (2NF), and nothing but the key (3NF), so help me Codd

# Forming Relationships with Multiplicity in a Database

Multiplicity is the relationship between entries in different tables, defined by a foreign key constraints

## Foreign Key
- Makes a relationship between table
- Do not need unique, however can be
- Can be made out of one or more columns
    - A foreign key made out of mulitple columns is called a composite key

## Four types of multiplicity

1. One-to-many: one entry in the first table can be mapped to many entries in the second table
    - The foreign key in the first table is allowed to map to multiple entries in the second table
2. Many-to-one: this is the opposite of one to many
3. Many-to-many: Many entries in the first table can be mapped to many entries in the second table
    - These are implemented with a junction table
4. One-to-one: a single entry in the first table is mapped to a single entry in the second table
    - The foriegn key is going to be unique

## Referential Integrity

- A foreign key is the reference to the relationship in multiplicity, and the rule ensures that a referenced record always exists
- You are not allowed to delete an entry if that entry is depended on by another row
- However, you can use `cascade delete`, which will delete all children and parent entries

# Views

Virtual tables in SQL, they are created with DQL statements

Advantages of Views:
- Gives access to some, but not all of the data in a table
- Hide the complexity of the database from users
- Allow uses to query normalized tables easier
- Changes to the underlying tables are automatically reflected in the view

## Transaction Control Language (TCL):

Used to manage transactions within a database
- Transaction is any change that happens our tables
- Syntax/Keywords for TCL:
    - COMMIT: this will perminently save any DML operations that occured
    - ROLLBACK: with will completely erase any non commited DML operations
        - Keep in mind, once you commit, you cannot roll back
    - SAVEPOINT: this creates a point to roll back to, but if you commit, it will be gone

## Properties of a transaction

In SQL every transaction must abide by these four properties, these are known as the ACID properties

## Four properties of a transaction

Atomic: All or nothing, the transaction is fully complete, or it doesn't happen at all

Consistency: The tables schema shall remain itact after the transaction

Isolation: Each transaction shall not affect another transaction

Durabilty: Data will persist through system crashes and other issues
