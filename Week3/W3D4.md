# Introduction to Maven

Maven is a dependency manager and build automation tool for Java programs

Maven project configurations and dependencies are handled in the Project Object Model, or the pom

## Project Coordinates

how Maven identifies projects, these are defined in the pom.xml and include:
- group-id: for example com.example
- artifact-id: for example myproject
- version: for example 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
- These uniquely indentify a specific version of a project

## Project Object Model

Contains information about the project used to build the project, including dependencies and plugins
- Some important tags in the pom:
    - `<project>` - this is the root tag of the file
    - `<modelVersion>` - defining which version of the page object model to be used
    - `<name>` - name of the project
    - `<properties>` - project specific properties
    - `<dependencies>` - this where you put your Java dependencies you want to you. Each one needs a `<dependency>` which has:
        - `<groupId>`
        - `<artifactId>`
        - `<version>`
    - `<plugins>` - third party plugins that work with Maven

## Maven Repositories

When Maven builds a project, it must search for any dependencies declared in the pom.xml

These dependencies are stored both locally and in a central repository

- Locally Maven store these dependencies in at $HOME/.m2/repository by default
- The central repository with is accessible at https://mvnrepository.com

If Maven cannot find a dependency locally, it will go to the central repo and download it

## Maven Lifecycles

When Maven builds a project, it takes all the source code, and dependencies and compiles and bundles it into an artifact, this can be a .war, .jar, or .ear,
- You can either run this directly, or deploay it onto a web containers

There three built in life cycles for Maven
- Default which handles project deployment
- Clean which handles project cleaning
- Site handles the creation of out project sites documentation

When Maven builds your project, it goes through several steps called phases. The default Maven build lifecycle foes through the following steps:

1. Validate => project is correct and all neccessary information is available
2. Compile => compiles the project source code
3. Test => test all compiled code
4. Package => packages all compiled code into WAR/JAR file
5. Integration => performs all integration tests
6. Verify => runs checks on the results of the integration tests
7. Install => install War/Jar to local repository
8. Deploy => copies the final Jar/War to the remote repository

# Introduction to JDBC

Java Database Connectivity, allows us to write java code to interact with relational databases

## Interfaces of JDBC

There are several classes and interfaces commonly used with JDBC, which can be found in the java.sql, and javax.sql packages:

- `DriverManager` class - to make a connection with a database driver
- `DataSource` interface - for retrieving connections, an alternative to `DriverManager`
- `Connection` interface - represents a physical connection with a database
- `SQLException` class - a gernal exception throw when something foes wrong when accessing the database
- `Statement` interface - used for executing static SQL statemtents
- `PreparedStatement` interface - represents a pre-compiled SQL statement
- `CallableStatement` interface - used to execute a stored procedure
- `ResultSet` interface - represents data returned from the database

## Setting up the Database Driver

To establish a connection to the database, we will need what is known as a driver
- These are database engine specific
- You can get these through Maven Dependencies in your pom.xml

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>42.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Connection Interface

To create a connection you use the DiverManager.getConnection() method, with these parameters
- URL to database (jdbc:postgresql://hostname:post/databasename)
- username
- password

After establishing a connection, you must use Statement to make the query on the Database

## Statement

Statement is an interface used for executing static SQL statements

To create a Statement you run the connection method createStatement()

## Prepared Statement

PreparedStatement is another interface used for executing pre-compiled SQL statements
- This protects against SQL injection
- This allows the flexibility of specifying parameters to pass into the query by using ?

To create a PreparedStatement you run the connection method prepareStatement()

You must set any parameters you declared before running the query
- with set...(columnNum, value)
    - replace the ... with whatever datatype you are setting

## ResultSet

To get the results of the Query you must store them in a result set

To get the ResultSet of the query you must call the appropriate execute method on the Statement or PreparedStatement object with the sql String

Example: `ResultSet rs = preparedStatement("select * from table");`

The ResultSet returns an Iterable of Objects that you must loop through and convert into java objects
