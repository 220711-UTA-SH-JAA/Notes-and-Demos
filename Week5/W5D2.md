# OOP Javascript

Object Oriented Programming Principles

- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

Javascript has what is known as prototypical inheritance:
- All javascript objects have "prototype", This is implemented through `__proto__` property
- This property can be used to define inheritance
- An objects `__proto__` property can be set to reference another object, creating inheritance
- The root proto of all JS objects is Object.prototype, this is the default value of `__proto__`

## Closures

Javascript uses closures for encapsulation
-   It is a nested function that can access the variables and arguments of its outer function, but can no longer change them

## JS Classes

Javascript uses classes for abstraction

-   Classes were introduced in ES6 as ways to create object templates, which allows us to create multiple objects with similar attributes
-   It also allows us to take advantage of inheritance through the extends keyword
-   Javascript even implemented the static keyword, which create field or function that belongs to the class itself
-   Classes have special methods called constructors that you can tell it how you want new objects from this class to be created
- Classes allow for public and private members
    - `#varName` will create a private member

# Modules

We can export and import peices of our Javascript code to and from different script files

-   You use the export statement to create a module
-   You use the import statement to use a module
-   We will see this be used a lot when we reach frontend frameworks

# Template Literal

A special way of declaring strings which allows developers to embed values in the string without concatenation
- These are string enclosed in backticks `
- It allows for embedded expressions, placeholders indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces
- ```javascript
  let s = 10;
  console.log(`We have ${s} assignments due this semester`);
  ```
- This will output: "We have 10 assignments due this semester"

# Iterators, Iterables, and Generators

## Iterator:
an object that allows you to traverse values associated with in in a defined sequence.
- Iterators have a `next()` method that returns two values, the next value, and done which is true or false
- You can retrieve an iterator from an array with the method called `iterator()`
- If the iterator is finished, every subsequent call to next will return next = undefined, done = true

## Generators
a special kind of iterator that returns a new value everytime `next()` is called until it reaches the `yield` keyword
- create a generator with the `*function` syntax

## Iterable:
An object that implements the `@@iterator` method (such as any Array) is considered to be an Iterable object. This means that they define iteration behavior and can be used in constructs such as a `for...of` loop. We make use of the `yield` keyword like we did in our generator functions, but we define `@@iterator`.

# strict mode

Declaring "use strict" in Javascript means that you will not be allowed to use:

-   undefined variables
-   any keyword as variable or function names
-   restricts some other niche instances

This was implemented in ES5

It can be declared at the global level, or at a function scope

# this keyword

The `this` keyword has multiple meanings based on where it is used

-   `this` alone refers to the global window object
-   `this` in event handlers refers to the HTML element that receieves the event
-   `this` in Object Method binding refers to the object

# DOM Structure

## Document Object Model (DOM):
Tree like structure representing the HTML document known as the DOM tree
- Allows Javascript to access and manipulate elements/styles on a webpage

![dom](./dom_structure.png)

The root of the DOM tree is our html tag, otherwise known as the document object
-   Every other element is a node that can be accessed via Javascript

To gain access to the DOM you simply use the `document` object in Javascript, it gives you access to methods to select elements, traverse, and manipulate the HTML page

# Selecting Elements

There are several ways to select an element in the DOM tree, these include:

-   `document.getElementById("idname")`: select a single element based off of its id attribute
-   `document.getElementsByClassName("classname")`: select a group of elements with the same class attribute
-   `document.getElementsByTagName("tag")`: selects all the elements with that specified tag
-   `document.querySelector("selector")` and `document.querySelectorAll("selector")`: select element/elements with by a specified CSS selector

# Traversing The Dom

The document object provides us ways to move through the tree with different properties gaining access to pretty much any object on the tree

To gain access to the top most nodes you can use:

-   `document.documentElement` to access the html elements
-   `document.head` to access the head tag
-   `document.body` to access the body tag

To gain access to the parent nodes of the currently selected element

-   `element.parentnode`
-   `element.parentElement`

To gain access to the children nodes of an element:

-   `element.childNodes`
-   `element.firstChild`
-   `element.lastChild`

To gain access to sibling nodes of an element:

-   `element.previousElementSibling`
-   `element.nextElementSibling`

# Dom Manipulation

On top of accessing, and traversing through the tree, you are also able to change/manipulate elements in the dom tree with Javascript

You can use `document.createElement()` to create an element and insert it into the dom tree

You can use `element.replaceChild()` to remove an element from the DOM and replace it with another

You can completely remove an element with `element.removeChild()`

You can insert a node before another with `element.insertBefore()`

You can use `element.innerText`, `element.textContent` to get or set the text of an html element

You get or set the HTML of an element with `element.innerHTML`

You can clone a node with the `element.cloneNode()` method

There are also many other useful methods and properties that you can leverage on the element objects in JS

You can use these methods to manage attributes of html elements:

-   `element.getAttribute("attname")`
-   `element.setAttribute("attname)`
-   `element.removeAttribute("attname")`
-   `element.hasAttribute("attname")`
