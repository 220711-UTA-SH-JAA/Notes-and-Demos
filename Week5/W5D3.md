# Events and Listeners

Events occur when a user interacts with a webpage, or when the browser triggers one

You can configure your webpage to handle these events with Javascript using an event handler, events you can handle include:

-   **onclick** - This is a click event occurs when a user clicks the element on a web page.

-   **ondblclick** - This is a click event occurs when a user double clicks the element on a web page.

-   **onload** - This is a load event occurs when the browser has finished loading the page.

-   **onunload** - This is a load event occurs when a user closes the document.

-   **onresize** - This is a load event occurs when the browser window is minimized or maximized.

-   **onmouseover** - This is a mouse event occurs when the user moves the mouse over an HTML element.

-   **onmouseout** - This is a mouse event occurs when the user moves the mouse away from an HTML element.

-   **onkeydown** - This is a keyboard event occurs when the user presses down a key on the keyboard.

-   **onkeyup** - This is a keyboard event occurs when the user releases a key on the keyboard.

-   **onfocus** - This is a form-input event occurs when the user gives focus to an element on a web page.

-   **onblur** - This is a form-input event occurs when the user takes the focus away from a form element or a window.

-   **onchange** - This is a form-input event that occurs when a user changes the value of a form element.

-   **onsubmit** - This is a form-input event that occurs when the user submits a form on a web page.

There are three ways you can register an event handler:

1. Inline, where you set the on... attribute of the html element to a predefined function in your js file
2. You can set the event property of the html element to a predefined function in js
3. You can use the `element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)` method

# The Event Object

In Javascript events are representated by an Event Object

Event objects have the following properties and methods

-   bubbles: a boolean value which indicates the propadation method, it is true by default
-   currentTarget: a reference to the DOM element whose event listener triggered the specific even.
    -   This is different from from the even that initially triggered the event as a single event can trigger multiple event listeners through propagation
-   preventDefault(): cancels the event/prevents the default action of that event
-   stopPropagation(): prevents the event from propagating further
-   target: a reference to the DOM element that triggered the event
-   timeStamp: the time of the event in miliseconds
-   type: the type of the event

## Types of Events

There are are several subclasses of the Event Object, which all include their own properties as well as the properties from the event object

-   A complete list of event object types: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_events.asp

### MouseEvent

This is an event that is generated when the user interacts with elements on the page with the mouse

Events like click, onmouseenter, onmouseleave create MouseEvent objects

The MouseEvent object has many properties that hold information about the state of the machine when the event occured, including:

-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the window: clientX and clientY
-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the last event: movementX and movementY
-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the target element: offsetX and offsetY
-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the the screen: screenX and screenY
-   Whether alt, ctrl, or shift were hit during the event: altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey
-   Which mouse button was hit: button, buttons and which

### KeyboardEvent

This is an event that is generated when the user interacts with elements on the page with the keyboard

You would typically use this to add extra functionality to webforms.

Events onkeydown, onkeypress, and on keyup create KeyboardEvent objects

The KeyboardEvent object has many properties including:

-   Whether alt, ctrl, or shift was hit during the event: altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey
-   Which key was hit: key, keycode, and which
-   Whether the key is being held down: repeat

# Bubbling/Capturing

Javascript has something called even propagation, which is essentially how the event flows through the components on the page

There are two ways in which an event can propagate, the first is called bubbling, the second is called capturing

## Event Bubbling

Bubbling is the default event propagation for event listeners

-   Follows a bottom up approach
-   The event starts at the target element, then "bubbles" its way up the tree

Essentially when a event happens, it first goes to any handlers on that element, then that elements parents, then grandparents, and so on until it reaches the top of the html document

Bubbling works for all handlers, regardless of how they are registered with the addEventListener()

## Event Capturing

Event capturing is the opposite of bubbling, instead of going from the target element to the top of the tree, it will start at the top and work its way down to the target element

-   This follows a top to bottom approach

Capturing only works with event handlers that are registered with .addEventListener() with an added third argument that is set to true

# Intro to Asynchronous Javascript

program does not need to wait for a specific task that takes a long time to complete

You can simply start a function that takes a while, then move on to a different function while the first one finishes
- You send an api request and forget about it
- When you receive the data back from the request, you can handle it
- Your program does not need to wait for that response to continue working

This is useful for API calls and other process that could hold up or block the execution of the main thread

## How Async Javascript works

Javascript also implements a stack like Java where the function calls are stored
- It uses a single thread to add, and call functions on the stack one at a time, until the stack is empty
- This is how our basic synchronous javascript script works

Javascript also has a queue built into it, along with this queue, the browser/runtime environment also has "web workers"/apis, that allow us to offload lengthy functions to them

After the webapi is done running the function, it puts a callback into that queue we mentioned above, and when javascript has emptied the callstack, it will look in this queue for any returned responses from the webapi

Simple example"

```javascript
const foo = () => console.log("First");
const bar = () => setTimeout(() => console.log("Second"), 500);
const baz = () => console.log("Third");
bar();
foo();
baz();
```

## The basic steps of the event loop

1. Asynchronous code gets added to the call stack
2. JS decides to hand it off to the web api where it processes
3. Other functions can be added and executing on the call stack while the web api does its work
4. Once the web api has a response, it gets added to the queue
5. The event loop checks the queue when the call stack is empty to see if there is something to add back to the stack
6. Our response/callback is added to the call stack and processed as normal

# AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)

the process of exchangin data from a webserver asynchronously with the help of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

- We use it to load data from a server, and selectively update some part of our webpage without reloading
- Uses the browsers built in XMLHttpRequest Object (XHR) to send and receive data from webservices asynchonously

The AJAX Workflow

1. A client event occurs on the webpage
2. Javscript will create the XMLHttpRequest object
3. The XHR makes an async request to the server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server create a response and send the data back to the client
6. The browser processes thje returned data using Javascript
7. The page content is updated with the data using Javascript

There are 4 steps to creating an AJAX Request

1. Create the XHR object with `new XMLHttpRequest()`
2. Set the readystatechange callback function
3. Use the `.open(method, url, async)` method of the XHR object to open the connection to the server
    - method is a string specifying the type of request (POST, GET, PUT,...)
4. Use the `.send()` method to send the request to the server to be processed

The server then sends back a response which can be processed, this is returned in the form of:
- responseText: the response as a string
- responseXML: the response as XML
- status: the status code for the response
- statusText: text representation of the status code

We make use of the XHR's property readyState and its function onreadystatechange to watch for when the response is ready to use

The readyState has 5 states
- 0: it is not initalized
- 1: the connection has been established
- 2: request was recieved by the server
- 3: server is proccessing the request
- 4: request is finished, and response is ready

You can also set the function onreadystatechange to some custom function to handle the response once our readyState is 4
- The onreadystatechange function gets called every time the state changes in the XHR object

# Working with JSON in AJAX

The XHR object can only send string in a request, however, we can still send JSON thanks to Javascripts functionality

Convert Json to a string with JSON.stringify()

Convert the string response to a javascript object with JSON.parse()

# Fetch API

fetch is a more modern way to send http requests from your browser via JS

It is provided by the window object and it povides the `.fetch()` method

- `.fetch()` is used to send requests and returns a promise that is retrieved from the response
- Successful requests get resolved, and the returned promise will have the response body
- Requests that return an error status code will be rejected

There are various methods you can use to access the body of the a successful response:

- `response.text()`: read the response and return as text
- `response.json()`: read the response and return as json
- `response.formData()`: return the response as form data
- `response.blob()`: return the respone as binary data with type
- `response.arrayBuffer()`: return the resonse as an arrayBuffer (low level representation of binary data)

# Promises

Javascript uses promises for async operations, they are placeholders for a future value. Many asyn functions will implicitly return promises

Promises in Javascript are objects, and you can create one if you wanted with the new keyword

Promises take a callback function called executor, this automatically runs when the object is created
- The executor also takes in two callback functions
    - `resolve(value)` this runs and returns whatever value if the promise is succesful
    - `reject(error)` this runs and returns an error when the promise is not successful

Promises also have a property called `status` which gives us information about the state of the object. The promise can be in one of three states:
- pending
- fulfilled
- rejected

The promise objects connects the executor and any consuming functions which will receive the result or the error from the promise

You would use `.then()` `.catch()` and `.finally()` to consume the data from the promise, and chain different consumer functions

# async/await

Introduced in ES8 to simplify asynchronous functionality

The async keyword denotes that a function will operate asynchronously via the event loop

- Any function with async keyword will implicitly return a promise object
- YOu can use any of the consumer functions on the return of an async function, however there is a much nicer way to handle these

The await key, this only works inside of async functions

- await tells Javascript to wait for a promise to resolve before moving on
- You can use await when calling a function that returns a promise, but it must be inside of an async function
- It allows you to gather data, or wait for something while also not blocking the thread

# Errors

When something goes wrong in Javascript an Error object is created, and there are two ways this can occur

1. Runtime error: An error that is created as a result of something wrong with the code
2. User defined error: An error built as part of your code to represent a problem that can occur.
    - These user defined fields can have many fields depending on implementation, the standard ones are name and message

## Handling Errors

You can handle an Error in Javascript with a try catch block
- Surround the at risk code in a try block
- If something occurs, we can handle the Error in the catch block. Similar to Java

## Throwing Errors

If you want to throw an error yourself, you can use the `throw` keyword
- You can actually throw anything in Javascript, but somethings wouldn't make much sense

## Custom Errors in Javascript

There are two ways to create a custom Error in Javascript

1. Creating a new function with a name and message field, set the prototype of the object to Error
2. Creating a class the extends Error, and passing in a message to the parent constructor using the `super()` keyword

# Rest With JSON (DEMO)

# Timing Events
are functions attached to the global window object, and allow programmers to automate or run tasks after waiting a specific amount of time.

These get handled by the even loop, and web threads

## setTimeout():
`window.setTimeout(callbackFunction, milliseconds)` will execute a callback function after waiting for a specified amount of milliseconds

Use the `window.clearTimeout(timeoutVariable)` to stop a timeout before the execution of the callback function

## setInterval():
`window.setInterval(callbackFunction, milliseconds)` continually execute a callback function every so many milliseconds

Use `window.clearInterval(intervalVariable)` to stop the the interval, similar to clearTimeout
