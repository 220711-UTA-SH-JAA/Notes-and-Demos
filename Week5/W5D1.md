# Javascript Introduction

High-leveled
- memory management and garbage collection
- easily human readible

Interpreted
- browser is going to read the javascript code line by line

Multi-paradigmed
- supports multiple programming paradigms such as as procedural, objected oriented, and functional

Dynamically Typed
- no static type checking, no need to declare a variable type, and you can reasign a variable to any type

Single Threaded
- runs off the event loop, multi-threading is not possible

It is the most commonly uised client side spripting/programming language
- Runs on the browser
- Primilary used to create dynamic webpages
- Runtimes such as NodeJS which allow it to be run outside of the browser
- Javascript has NOTHING to do with Java

Javascript follows the specifications set out by ECMAScript

- This is where JS gets its versions
- For example some versions of JS include ES5, ES6, ES7, ES2020

## Linking your HTML and JS

HTLM supports the use of Javascript with the `<script>` tag, you can either write javascript directly inside of these tags, or you can link an external file
- Javascript written inside of the script tags is known as internal javascript
- Javascript written inside of a file is known as external javascript
- The script tag can in the head or the body blocks, but the best practice is at the end of the body

## JS Syntax and Variables

Syntax Rules:
- Case sensitive
- Semicolons are optional
- Spacing/white space doesn't matter
- Single and multiline comments are the as java

Javascript Variables
- Used store data/values
- Use the keyword `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable
- Variables have a name and a value you assign to them, just like java
- Cannot be named a keyword, cannot start with a number or special character (execpt for `$` and `_`), and cannot contain spaces
- Literals in javascript are fixed values, aka your primitives

## Data types

Javascript has 7 primitives
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object
- Symbol (es6 thing)

Strings:
- Simply text enclosed by single or double quotes
- `var s = 'this is a valid string'`
- `var s = "this is also a valid string"`

Numbers:
- Can be positive and negative
- Can be decimal or non-decimal
- Include special datatypes such as infinity, NaN (Not a Number), bigInt
- `var n = 4;`
- `var n = 3.5`
- `var inf = infinity`

Boolean:
- Simple true or false
- `var f = false;`
- `var t = true;`

Null:
- Refers to nothing
- IT IS NOT THE SAME AS EMPTY STRING OR 0

Undefined:
- The variable was declared, but not initalized
- `var x;`
    - This variable was created, but it was never never defined

## Objects

A set of key value pairs, the key is a string, and the value can be anything, inlcuding another object or an array
- You can access the objects properties using dot notation or bracket
- ```javascript
  let obj = {
      name: "Ethan",
      title: "Trainer",
      company: "Revature"
  };

  var name = obj.name;
  var title = obj[title];

  obj.company = "Microsoft";
  obj[name] = "Ethan McGill";
  ```

## Arrays
Are objects which store a list of values
- Allowed to store and and all datatypes in an array
- Index start at 0
- Values can be accessed by the associated index inside of brackets
- Arrays also include a length property which indicates how many values are stored in the array
- Arrays in JS are dynamically sized, they size will automatically grow or shrink as you add items
- Arrays come with several build in methods:
    - .push()
    - .pop()
    - .foreach()
    - .filter()
    - .map()
    - .slice()

## Spread/rest operators

Special operators we can use on Arrays or Objects in JS to break apart or combine existing Arrays or Objects

Spread operator is used to combine arrays, or gain access to each individual element in an array or property in an object

Rest operator is used as a way to pass in an unlimited about of arguments into a function, in other words it acts the same as Java varargs

# Operators and Control Flow

Javascript operators perform some operations on a single or multiple operands and produce a result

There are five types of operators in Javascript
- Arithmetic -, +, `*`, /, %, ++, --
- Comparison: ==, ===, !=, >, <. >=, <=
- Logical: &&, ||, !
- Assignment: =, +=, -=, `*=`, /=, %=
- Ternary: condition ? true : false

Control Flow:

- if/else
- for
- for in
    - Enhanced for loop which loops through the properties of an object
- for of
    - Enhanced for loop which loops through the elements of an array
- while
- do while

# Type Coercion

the process of converting a value from one datatype to another datatype

There are two types of type coercion, explicit and implicit

- Explicit occurs when we specify it to happen
    - `var num = new Number("3")`
- Implicit occurs automatically by Javascript, it happen some times when javascript is attempting to carry out some instruction
    - `var div = "3"/4`

## Differcent between == and ===

They are used to compare object in Javascript
- == compares two values and does not take into account their types
- == essentially performs type coercion to see if the values being compared are the same
- === compare the two values and will check strictly against their types and their values
- === will only return true if the value AND the types are the same

### TLDR: === does strict comparison, type and value must equals, == only compares the value

## Truthy and Falsy in Javascript

In Javascript any expression or value that results in a boolean false is considered falsy, these include:

- boolean false
- empty string ''
- Undefined
- null
- Nan
- 0

Everything else is truthy

# Functions

a peice of reusable code that can be called anywere in the program
- define them using the `function` keyword, and they take in as many parameters as you like
- you can use the `return` keyword to return something from the function
- ```javascript
  function nameOfFunction(params){
      return is optional
  }
  ```
## Types of functions in JS

Function expression
- anonymous function
- no identifier/name they are stored in variables becuase functions are objects

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
- an anonymous function that calls itself instantly

Callback function
- function that gets passed into another functions as a parameter, and then gets executed once the orginal function is finished executing
-   This is helpful with asynchronous code
-   All functions are objects, so they can be passed in the other function parameters
-   A callback function can be created using the `callback` keyword

Arrow Function
- A new simplified way to write concise functions
- Looks like this `var func = (args) => expression`
- Multilined arrow function must have curly braces around its expressions

## Default Parameters

allow programmers to set a value to a function parameter incase no value is passed to the function

# Variable Scopes

The scope of a variable defines the lifetime and visibility of a variable in a Javascript program.
- they cannot be accessed outside of thir scope

Two major divisions of scope: Global and Local

## Global Scope:
accessible everywhere in the application, and has a lifetime of the application

## Local Scope:
accessible only in their location 

Local scope is broken into Function and Block Scope

## Function Scope:
variables declared inside of a function are only accessible inside of that function, and their lifetime is the span of the function

## Block Scope:
Introduced in ES6, varibles with the keyword let and const can only be accssesed inside of their block {} of code, lifetime again is just the span of that block of code

# Hoisting:
variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before code execution
-   Only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments
-   Only variables declared with the keyword var are hoisted out of block scope

# let and const keywords

let and const were introduced in ES6 as means of preventing hoisting from block scope

The let keyword allows you to declare a variable in block scope without it being hoisted

The const keyword also allosws you to declare a variable in block scope without being hoisted, however it is also treated as a constant and cannot be reassinged

It is now considered to be best practice to use let and const over the var keyword
