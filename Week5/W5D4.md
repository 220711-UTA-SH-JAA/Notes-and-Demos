# NodeJS

NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform, run-time environment for Javascript built on Chromes V8 engine

-   It is NOT a programming language
-   It is a run-time environment that allows you to run Javascript code outside of the browser

npm or Node Package Manager is a package manager for the Javascript Programming lanugage. It is the default package manager for the Javascript environment

npm consists of three components:

-   the website: discovers packages, setup profiles, and manage access to packages
-   CLI runs from a terminal and allows us to interact with npm
-   the registry is a public database of Javascript pacakages

We use Node and npm as tools for building Angular

Have them install Node from here nodejs.org

# Package.json

When you create a Javascript Project with Node it automically creates a package.json in the root directory of the project

The package.json holds information or metadata about the project, including:

-   description
-   version
-   license information
-   author
-   entry point
-   dependencies
-   scripts

There are two type of dependencies in the package.json

-   dependencies: are essential to running the application
-   devDependencies: are dependencies that are only being used during development of the application
