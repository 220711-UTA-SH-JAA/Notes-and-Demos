# Java 8 Features

Java 8 implemented many new and useful features including

-   Functional Interfaces
-   Lamda Expressions
-   Stream API
-   Reflections API
-   Date and Time API
-   Optional Classes
-   Predicates

# Fuctional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are interfaces with only one abstract method.
- Implicitly created by lambdas
- Can be explicitly created for use by lambdas

# Lamdas:
possibly the biggest addition to Java 8, they introduce important aspects of functional programming, allow for disembodied methods, aka functions


The basic syntax is `parameter(s) -> expression`

For multiple parameters parenthesis are required, for multiple lines of logic in the expression curly braces are required

The return keyword is optional for single expression lambdas

Lambdas are used a lot in conjunction with forEach loops on collections, and with the Streams API to apply perform some logic before passing data to the next stream

# Date and Time API:

Before Java 8 Dates and Times were separate, represented by java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar, and there were issues with these classes

Java introduced a new APU through the java.time package which includes:

-   LocalDate - only contains date information
-   LocalTime - only contains time information
-   LocalDateTime - contains a date and time
-   ZonedDateTime - for working with time zones
-   Period - represents a quantity of time (years, months, days)
-   Duration - represents quantity of time (seconds, nanoseconds)
-   DateTimeFormatter - for representing dates/times in a given format

## DateTimeFormatter

Provides Static Variables, and other methods to parse and format dates and times in just about everyway imagineable

## Optional Class:

The optional class was introduced to reduce the need for excessive null value checking

An Optional is a wrapper object which may or may not contain a value, with a few helpful helper methods

They are useful as replacements for null values when returning an empty response from a method

Example:

```java
public class OptionalExample {
  public Optional<String> getAmbiguousString(boolean b) {
    if (true) {
	  return Optional.of("awesome string!");
	} else {
	  return Optional.empty();
	}
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Optional<String> optString = getAmbiguousString(false);
	String theString = optString.orElse(""); // specify a fallback value
	System.out.println(theString);
	// we can use the String without fear of NullPointerException now
  }
}
```

# Stream API

The Stream API is a functional-style of defining operations on a stream of elements.

-   Streams are an abstraction which allow defining operations which do not modify the source data, and are lazily loaded

Streams do not store data, they simply operate on data, like filtering, mapping, or reducing it

Streams are divided into two streams:

-   Intermediate, return a new stream and are always lazy, they don't execute until the terminal operation is called
-   Terminal, trigger the execution of the stream pipeline, which allows effiecency by performing all operations in a single pass over the data

Reduction operations take a sequence of elements and combine them into a single result

-   .reduce() and .collect() are implemented by many Stream classes for this purpose

Example:

```java
List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
// add students...
List<Double> grades = students.stream()
                          .filter(s -> s.isAttending())
						  .mapToDouble(s -> s.getGrade)
						  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

# Object Relational Mapping

ORM's converts the data between relational databases and object-oriented programming langauges

-   Essentially turns a Java object, into a entry in a database table for us

Most object-oriented applications store data in relational-databases which use tables, while the application classes create objects, in order to get data from one to another we must do some conversion

This conversion makes it impossible to directly store objects into relational-databases, this difference is called impedance mismatch.

Impedance mismatch can exist at the following points:

-   Granularity: refers to the mismatch in the number of classes that are mapped with a certain number of tables in the database
-   Interitance: tables within the database cannot be represented through an inheritnance hierarchy
-   Identity: The relational database distingishes an object instance on the basis of their primary key. However, an object model distinguishes the basis on object identity and object equality
-   Association: In the object model, two classes are linked by association. However, in relational databases, the linking of tables is achieved with the help of foreign keys
-   Navigation: The ways of accessing objects in Java and in RDBMS are fundamentally different

Benefits of ORM's

-   ORM maps an object to the table.
-   We can hide the details of SQL queries from OO logic. This propagates the idea of data abstraction.
-   It provides methods for automatic versioning and timestamping.
-   It provides caching support for better performance.
-   Best suited for large projects
-   Injected transaction management
-   Configurable logging
-   Faster development of applications

There are lots of ORM tools available such as Hibernate, JPA, Active JPA, iBATIS, IBM Pure Query, etc.

# Hibernate and JPA

## JPA

JPA is the Java Persistence API, and it is the standard API for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects/classes and a relational database

You can find it in the javax.persistence package

-   It uses the Java Persistence Query Language: which is a object oriented query language
-   It uses EntityManager: an interface to create, read, delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes

## Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM tool for Java programming

-   It is a flexible and powerful ORM solution to map Java classes to database tables
-   It is an implementation of JPA, so it follows the standards provided by JPA
-   It is defined in the org.hibernate package
-   It used Hibernate Query Language which is similar to JPQL
-   Hibernates session interface is an extension to JPA's EntityManager

Why we shouldn't use JDBC anymore

-   Large applications result in significant complexity
-   Changing our database may result in significant refactoring
-   Must convert database ResultSet objects to Java objects, and vise versa manually
-   The developer requires database specific knowelege
-   The states of Java Objects are fetched and managed by developers

The benefits of Hibernate

-   Transparent persistence ensures the automatic connection between the application's objects with the database tables
-   Hibernate is database independent
-   Hibernate framework provides abstraction, including establishing a connection, writing queries to perform CRUD and more
-   Hibernate supports dual-level caching, making hibernate highly scalable

# Hibernate Architecture

Hibernate is broken up into several key interfaces, which make up what we call the Hibernate Architecture

![hibernate-arch](hib-arch.png)

Persistent objects are instances of POJO classes, that each represent a row in a table in the database

# Interfaces of Hibernate

Configuration (class): represents a configuration or properties file for hibernate. Created once during application initialization.

-   It is used to create the SessionFactory
-   The configure() method loads mapping and properties from the hibernate.cfg.xml
-   addAnnotatedClass() method is used to specify an entity class
-   setProperty() method is used to add properties like hibernate.connection.url
-   An exception will be thrown if the config file is not valid

SessionFactory (interface): is used to create a Session. It is a thread-safe and immutable object mapped to a single database. It also holds the second level cache

Session (interface): is created by the SessionFactory, and used to perform CRUD operations

-   Session Objects wrap the JDBC connection and serve as a factory of Transaction, Query, and Criteria objects
-   Session Objects are not thread safe
-   Lightweigh, and holds the mandatory first-level cache
-   Perform CRUD opertaions with:
    Create: .save(), .persist(), .saveOrUpdate()
    Read: .get(), .load()
    Update: .update(), .merge()
    Delete: .delete()

Transaction (interface): a transaction is associated with a Session, and typically instantiated by a call to Session.beginTransaction()

-   Transaction object is used whenever we perform any operation and based apon that operation there is some change to the database
-   You can do several operations then commit the transaction
-   We can also rollback all previous uncommitted operations, transactions are not automatically committed
-   Transactions are handled by the underlying transaction manager and JDBC transaction or JPA transaction

Query (interface): an instance is obtained by calling Session.createQuery()

-   Can be used to expose extra functionality beyond that provided by Session.iterate() and Session.find()
-   You may select a particular page of a result set by calling setMaxResults() or setFirstResult()
-   You can use named query parameters
-   Can write queries in Native SQL or HQL

Criteria (interface): is a simplified API for retrieving entities by composing Criterion objects

-   You can create a Criteria object with session.createCriteria()

# XML Overview

XML stands for extensible markup language

It was designed to transport and store data in a way that is both machine and human readible

You can parse XML with Java using JAXP

You can Bind XML in Java using JAXB

-   Binding is converting XML to Java objects or vice versa

# Hibernate configuration

The hibernate configuration file is the hibernate.cfg.xml file, and it stores database mapping information that tells Hibernate how it should communicate with the database, and where the mapping for individual classes/tables can be found

-   Data stored includes JDBC connection IRL, db user credentials, driver class, and hibernate dialect

This file gets loaded through the Configuration class and creates a SessionFactory

The root tag of the hibernate.cfg.xml file is `<hibernate-configuration>`, inside of this is the `<session-factory>` tag which will store all the database information.

`<mapping>` element takes a single Java class that is mapped to a table

-   If you are using annotations you should use the attribute class
-   If you are using a xml file you should use the attribute resource

Other important hibernate.cfg.xml properties include:

-   **hibernate.dialect** - specifies the type of database used in hibernate so that hibernate generates the appropriate type of SQL statements. The [org.hibernate.dialect](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/javadocs/org/hibernate/dialect/package-summary.html) package contains the SQL dialect for the databases.
-   **hibernate.connection.driver_class** - used to register or load the JDBC driver class. The name should be fully qualified class name like `oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver` for oracle , `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` for MySQL, etc.
-   **hibernate.connection.url** - used to mention the JDBC URL to the database instance.
-   **hibernate.connection.username** - username used to connect to the database.
-   **hibernate.connection.password** - password for the username being used to connect to the database.
-   **hibernate.connection.pool.size** - used to limit the number of connections waiting in the Hibernate database connection pool.
-   **show_sql** - If this property value is _true_ then it enables the logging of all hibernate-generated SQL statements to the console.
-   **format_sql** - If this property value is _true_ then it formats the generated SQL statement to make it more readable.
-   **use_sql_comments** - If this property value is _true_ then it insert comments inside all generated SQL statements.
-   **hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto** - used to create, update or validate the database schema DDL when the SessionFactory Object created. The four possible values for this property are,
    -   **create** - creates new database tables based on your class mappings. If a table already exists, then it will drop the existing table and create a new table.
    -   **update** – Updates the existing database tables to match the class mappings. If a table doesn't exist, then it creates a new table.
    -   **validate** - validates the existing tables against the provided mappings, and doesn't make any changes to the database. If the validation fails, the application will not work properly.
    -   **create-drop** - as create, but explicitly drops all existing tables when the SessionFactory is closed (which of course loses all the data in those tables).

You can also use a hibernate.properties file, however you cannot map classes with this file, so you would have to manually use the Configuration class to map you classes
