# Object States

In hibernate, an object of a persistent class can be in one of three states. These states are defined in relation to a persistence context (Session object).

1. Transient

    - When an object is created with the new keyword but not yet associated with a hibernate session
    - It doesn't represent a row in the database
    - Transient instances are garbage collected if the application does not hold a reference anymore

2. Persistant

    - The object state is persistent when it is associcated with a hibernate session
    - The persistent object represents a row in the database and has an identifier value
    - Transient instances can be made persistent by associating them with a session
    - The .save(), .persist(), and .saveOrUpdate() methods try to associate a transient object with a session and make them presistent
    - Hibernate detects the changes made to persistent objects and sychronizes the state with the database
    - Whenever we get data from the database using .get() or .load() methods, the data will be in the persistent state

3. Detached
    - When a persistent object has its sessions closed it becomes detached
    - Any changes made to detached objects will not save automatically to the database
    - When a detached instance reattached with a new Session at a later point in time, it makes the object persistent again
    - The Session class' .close(), .evict(), and .clear() methods are used to move a persistent object to the detached state
    - Thes Session class' .update() and .merge() methods can be used to reattach objects to a session

# Named Queries

Names queries are a SQL expression with a predefined unchangable query string.

These can be defined either in the hibernate mapping file, or in the entity class

To declare them in the entity class you can use these annotations:

-   `@NamedQueries` - used to define the multiple HQL expressions.
-   `@NamedQuery` - used to define the single HQL expression.
-   `@NamedNativeQueries` - used to define the multiple native SQL expressions.
-   `@NamedNativeQuery` - used to define the single native SQL expression.

`@NamedQuery` has two attributes:

-   **name** - used to specify a name by which a session object can locate the query.
-   **query** - used to specify the HQL statments.

# Caching

Hibernate performs caching to optimize the performance of an application

There are two levels of caching in hibernate, L1 and L2

First-Level/L1:

-   The first place hibernate looks for data
-   This is automatically implemented by hibernate
-   Associated with the Session Object, and cannot be accessed by other Sessions
-   Only useful with repeated queries on the same session
-   We query data, and it hibernate puts that data into the cache, and if we send the same query we don't have to hit the database

Second-Level/L2:

-   If the data is not in L1, then hibernate will look in L2
-   This is an optional cache, that must be implemented through a third party
    -   L2 can be implemented with an technology that supports out-of-the-box integration with Hibernate
-   The cache is associated with the SessionFactory, all sessions have access to it
-   If the data is not in the L1 cache, and not in the L2 cache, then the database will finally be hit

To enable L2 cache we have to first configure it in the hibernate configuration file with:

-   `<property name="cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property>`
-   `<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">classpathforcache</property>`

You must also annotate the entity class with @Cache, and provide a cache concurency strategy these include:

-   **READ_ONLY** - Use this strategy only for entities where we never change any data and use data as a reference.
-   **NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE** - Doesn't guarantee the consistency between the cache and the database. Use this strategy only for entities where we change data rarely.
-   **READ_WRITE** - Use this strategy only for entities where we read and update data.
-   **TRANSACTIONAL** - Use this strategy to cache the full transactions made on the entity.

It is also reccomended to annotate the entity class with @Cacheble

# ACID Properties Review

Atomic: All or nothing, the transaction is fully complete, or it doesn't happen at all

Consistency: The tables schema shall remain itact after the transaction

Isolation: Each transaction shall not affect another transaction

Durabilty: Data will persist through system crashes and other issues

# Overview of logging

Logging records events that occur during the execution of your program

-   They allow for developers to access information about applications which we do not have direct access
-   Without logs developers would have no idea what went wrong when the application crashes

We will be using Logback for logging:

- Logback is a successor of the older logging library log4j
- It is an implementation of the slf4j logging interface, so we will need also include that package

Logback allows us to use various logging levels, and configurable thresholds that determine which messages will be recorded in the application log files

Logback Logging Levels:

1. ALL => all levels
2. DEBUG => designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application
3. INFO => informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at the coarse grained level
4. WARN => designates potentially harmful situations
5. ERROR => designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running
6. FATAL => severe error events that presumably lead the application to abort
7. OFF => highest possible level, intended to turn off logging

## Setting Logging Threshold

We use configuration file called logback.xml in our java/resources folder

To set the logging level, you set the level attribute of the root tag to which ever level you like

# Service Locator Design Pattern

The service locator design pattern is used to encapsulate the processes involved in obtaining a service in a layer of abstraction. It has a centra; registry known as the Service locator which is responsible for returning instances of service objects based on requests from clients.

![servicelocator](service-locator.png)

Design components:

-   **Client** - responsible for invoking services via the ServiceLocator.

-   **Service Locator** â€“ is a single point of contact for returning services to the client from the cache. It abstracts the lookup and/or creation of services.

-   **Initial Context** - this creates, registers, and caches services. It is the starting point of the lookup and creation process.

-   **Service Factory** - it provides lifecycle management for the service, which helps to create, register, lookup, or remove services from the cache.

-   **Service** - the implementation of the service, which will process the request.
