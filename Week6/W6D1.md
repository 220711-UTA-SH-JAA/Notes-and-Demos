# Threads and Concurency

Concurency refers to breaking up a task into different parts that can be executed independent of one another, in any order without affecting the final outcome

(Paraphrase) Examples of this are in operating systems running multiple programs at once, and the physical CPU's having multiple cores to process different applications on different cores, allowing for true parallelization, which is what we are trying to achieve with multi-threading

## Threads:

A thread is a subset of a process that is also an independent sequence of execution.

-   Threads of the main process will run in the same memory space, but managed independently by the scheduler

Every thread has its own call stack where it stores local variable references, but since they share the same heap memory multiple threads can access the same objects in memory

## Multithreading
is the idea of using multiple threads in applications to achieve parallelism

-   Each thread can perform its own task increasing effiency

In Java we achieve multi-threading with the Thread class or the Runnable interface

In general it is best practice to not attempt to implement multithreading yourself, because it can lead to issues we will speak about later

-   You are encouraged to use frameworks and api's to implement multithreading for you

# States of Threads

Threads follow a lifecycle with six different states:

1. New: newly created thread that has not started executing

2. Runnable: either running or ready for execution but waiting for its resource allocation

3. Blocked: waiting to acquire a monitor lock to enter or re-enter a synchronized block/method

4. Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perform an action without any time limit

5. Timed_Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perform a specific action for a specified time period

6. Terminated: has completed its execution

Threads also have priorites which signify which order they should be run. The thread class contains a few static variables for priority

-   MIN_PRIORITY = 1
-   NORM_PRIORITY = 5, default
-   MAX_PRIORITY = 10

# Custom Threads

You can create your own custom threads in one of two ways, extending the the Thread class, or implementing the Runnable interface:

# Thread Class

Creating a thread with extending the Thread class will grant you access to the thread classes methods:

-   getters and setters for id, name, and priority
-   interrupt() to explicitly interrupt the thread
-   isAlive(), isInterrupted() and isDaemon() to test the state of the thread
-   join() to wait for the thread to finish execution
-   start() to actually begin thread execution after instantiation

To create this thread you simply:

1. Create a class that extends Thread
2. Implement the run() method
3. Use the custom thread with the .start() method

# Runnable Interface

Creating a thread with implementing the Runnable interface will give you the freedom to extends a different class of your liking

To create a thread this way you simply:

1. Create a class that implements Runnable
2. Implement the run() method
3. To use this thread you must create a generic thread object and pass your custom runnable object in as a parameter to the constructor

# Thread Problems

There are issues that can occur if you try to implement multithreading yourself. One of these issues is Deadlock

## Deadlock
occurs when two or more threads are blocked trying to access the same resource, waiting for one another. Neither thread can continue execution, so the program halts indefinitely. 

## Livelock
is similar to a deadlock, expect instead of waiting on a lock, the states of the processes involved constantly keep changing with regard to one another, neither able to progress

These issues arewhere Synchronization comes in

## Synchronization
the capablity to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource

To do this we use the synchronized keyword. The synchronized keyword enforces that only one thread can access the resource at a given time

Another problem multithreaded programs can run into is the producer consumer problem

# Producer Consumer Problem

In this problem we have a fixed size buffer that is shared between the producer and the consumer

-   The producer adds to the buffer
-   The consumer takes from the buffer

The problem is that data should only be added if the buffer is not full, and data should only be consumed if the buffer is not empty.

To solve this we can use the synchronized keyword, as well as the .wait() and .notify() methods to communicate across threads.

-   .wait() can pause the consumer depending on the amount of data in the buffer
-   .notify() can send a notification to either thread when they can be used

(Paraphrase) Essentially, the producer will produce until the buffer is full, while the consumer waits. When the buffer fills up, wait will be called on the producer, and consumer will be notified, then the consumer will use up all the data in the buffer, then wait and notify the producer when it is empty
