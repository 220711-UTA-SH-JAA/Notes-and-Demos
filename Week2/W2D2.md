# Object Oriented Programming In Java

## Encapsulation

The first and most straight forward pillar is Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the idea in programming to hide the states of your objects, but make them available through mutator methods

We can implement Encapsulation using access modifiers and mutator methods
- The mutators used to get a value from an encapsulated class is called a getter, typically denoted with the method name `getStateVal()`
- The mutators used to set a value in an encapsulated class is called a setter, typically denoted with the method name `setStateVal()`

## Java Modifiers

Modifiers in Java are keywords that modify the functionality of our java classes, methods, and class members
- Two types of modifiers, access and non-access

Access Modifiers are keywords that define the ability of other classes to access the given property/entity

We have four available access modifiers
- public: available everywhere
- protected: available within the same package and subclasses
- default: available within the same package
- private: only available within the same class

Non-access modifiers modify the functionality of our java code but not the access

- There are technically 7 non-access modifiers, but we will typically only see/use 4

`static` denotes a class member has class/static scope
- if a variable or method is denoted as static, that means it belongs to the class
- Static methods can only be access by other static class members
    - Primarily useful because you don't need an instance of the class to call the method
    - `MyClass.staticMethod()`
- Static variables will be the same across all instances of that class
    - This saves on memory because it is shared across all objects of the class
    - Don't need an instance of the class to gain access to the variable
        - `MyClass.staticVariable`

`final` keyword makes whatever it is applied to unchangeble
- when applied to a variable in a class, you cannot reassign the variable
    - final variables can be cached by the JVM to increase performance of the program
    - final variables are safe to share in multithreading environments without extra additional synchronization overhead
- when applied to a class, you cannot extend the class
- when applied to a method, you cannot override the method

`abstract` keyword means two things depending on where it is applied
- when applied to a class, the class can no longer be instantiated dirtectly, you must inherit the class
- when applied to a method, the method cannot have a body, it must be given this implemenation in an extended class (childclass)
    - You are only allowed to have abstract methods inside of an abstract class

`transient` marks a variable of a class not to be serialized
- If you were to write an object to a file, the field marked as transient would be ignored when writing to said file

## POJO vs Bean

A POJO is a Plain Old Java Object

A Java bean is a special POJO with the following properties
- All Java Beans are POJO's, but not all POJO's are java beans
- They must serializable, ie they can be written to a file
- All fields should be private
- Fields should have getters and setters
- There should at least be a no-args constructor
- Fields are accessed only by constructors or getters and setters

A Java bean is a perfectly encapsulation java object which can be written to a file

# Java OOP Inheritance

Inheritance is were a base class (or parent class) passes traits/behaviors down to a sub-class (or child class)

- This create a parent-child reationship or a is-a relationship between classes
- All non-private fields and methods are inheritied by the child class

In Java we implement inheritance by using the `extends` keyword in our class declaration

Inhertiance is useful because:
- It allows code to be more resuable and modular
- It helps avoid boilerplate code (redudant), helping us abide by the common programming guideline DRY (DONT REPEAT YOURSELF)

## Shadowing:
the practice in Java programming of having two variables with the same name within scopes that overlap

- When this happens, the higher level scope is hidden because the variable with the lower level scope overrides it
- When a parent and a child share the same variable name, the childs will shadow the parents variable

It is important to note, that in Java there is no mutliple inheritance through classes, meaning one class can only ever extend on other class directly
- This is because two different classes could have the same method, and the sub class would not know/understand which one of these to use

However, classes in Java are allowed to implement any number of interfaces, making multiple inheritance possible through the use of interfaces
- This is because interfaces don't care what the implementation, as long as the method stub is filled out

We use the `super()` keyword in our child class constructors to set properties in our parent class
- `super()` makes a call to the parent classes constructor, the specific constructor depends on if you pass parameters into the super call
- `super()` is implicitly called as the first line of every constructor
- We can explicitly call it, but it MUST be the very first line of the constructor

In classes where we are not inheriting andthing, the super will still get called, but it will call the constructor of the Object class

# Object class

In Java the Object class is the root of all classes

Therefore, all classes in Java will have these methods defined by the Object class:

- Object clone()
- boolean equals(Object o)
    - by default .equals() acts the same as ==, but if override the functionality we can compare different aspects of the object
- void finalize()
- Class<?> getClass()
- int hashCode()
    - returns an int indicating the hashcode,
    - If you override the .equals() you are also expected to override hashCode()
    - The result of hashCode for an object should not change during the programs life
    - if .equals() returns true, the hashcode should be the same
    - if .equals() returns false, that doesn't mean the hashcodes are different
- void notify()
- void notifyAll()
- String toString(): print a stringified version of the object, if not overriden it will just print out the class path
- void wait()
- void wait(long timeout)
- void wait(long timeout, int nanos)

# Annotations 

Annotations are special constructs in Java which use the @ symbol followed by the name of the annotation
- Annotations provide metadata to the compiler about the source code

Annotations can be placed over classes, methods, interfaces, and other constructs

Annotations are often used by libraries to abstract away functionality, or enforce some set of rules
- Annotations are often processed by the reflections api

Some examples:
- @Override
- @Deprecated
- @SuppressWarnings
- @FunctionInterfaces

# Java OOP Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take on many forms

The most common ways this is achieved is:
- Method overloading
- Method overriding
- covariance
- casting

## Method Overloading

Two or more methods with the same name, but have different method signatures by changing their paremeter list

You can change the number of parameters, the types of parameters, or the order in which the parameters are passed
- The return type must stay the same
- Which method runs is determined at compile time, making it compile time polymorphism

## Method Overriding

A method in a child class has the same name and signature as a method in the parent class, but has a different implenation

Overriding methods makes class hierarchies more flexible and dynamic

Method overriding is a form of run-time polymorphism because of virtual method invocation

If a subclass implements the same static method as its parent, the method is hidden. Method hiding replaces the parent method in the calls defined by the child class.

### Covariant Return Types:

When overriding a method, you can change the return type as long as it is a subclass of the original return type

You can change the access modifer as long as it is not more restrictive

You can change the exception throws declaration as long as the new exception is a subclass of the original

## Casting

Upcasting, allows you to assign a child object to a parent object, this works because the child will have all the properties and methods of the parent object, however, it may be missing some of the child functionalities

Downcasting is the opposite, it allows you to assign a parent object to child object, however you cannot garentee that the parent object will have all the properties of the child, leading to problems

# Java OOP Abstraction

Abstraction is a programming principle in which we centralize common characteristics and generalize behavior into conceptual classes

With abstraction you hide the underlying complexity through a simplified interface

Essentially hiding how something functions, but still allowing users to know what the functions are

In java abstraction is done through abstract classes and interfaces

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are more general classes that cannot be instantiated, they act as a template for other classes to inherit

Abstract classes are created with the `abstract` keyword, and can contain both regular methods and abstract methods
- Abstract methods must be implemented by the inheriting class

## Interfaces

Interfaces are contracts for methods that classes must implement, interfaces also cannot be instantiated directly

Interfaces are implicitly public and abstract
- Every method in an interface is public and abstract
- Interfaces can have variables, but they will be implicitly public static final
- In Java 8 `default` methods were added, which allows programmers to implement functionality inside of an interface

To inherit from an interface, a class must use the `implements` keyword in the class declaration

## Marker Interface

Are interfaces that contain no methods or constants, its soul purpose is to provide runtime information to the compiler. Examples include Seriablizable, and Cloneable
