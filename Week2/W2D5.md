# Intro to TDD and Unit Testing

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a process of writing tests for your code, then implementing the code to pass those tests
- This help increase our code coverage

## Red/Green Testing

Red/Green testing is assocaited with TDD, and it is the process of writing a test befroe the code which will result in red

Write the code to pass that specific test which will result in a green

Then you write a new test, that is more specific, run it, will fail back to red

Refactor your code to pass that new test (green)

The general process can be broken down into 5 steps

1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test (it will fail)
3. Write code to pass the test
4. Refactor/write a more advanced test
5. Refactor the code and repeat

# Unit Tests

Unit Testing is the testing of individual software components in isolation from the rest of the software

It can also sometimes be called White Box testing:
- A testing method in which the internal design of the module/unit being tested is known to the tester

Unit testing can find if/where something goes wrong in your code
- This helps reduce debugging time because you know where to look for an issue in your code
- It also increse code coverage, because you should be testing each individual unit/module in your code
- It increases confidence in changing and maintaining your code

It is best practice to not only test edge cases, but also include negative test cases

# JUnit and Mockito

## JUnit is a Java framework for unit testing

Uses annotations to create tests and setup testing environments
- `@Test` - declares a method as a test method
- `@BeforeClass` - declare a method to be run before any of the test methods get one, it will be called upon once per test suite
- `@Before` - declare a method to be run once before ever testing method in the test suite
- `@After` - declare a method to be run once after every testing method in the test suite
- `@AfterClass` - declare a method to be run once after all of the tests of been run in the test suite

JUnit also has built in static methods to use in your testing methods to verify that the state of your application is what is expected
- `assertTrue()`
- `assertFalse()`
- `assertEquals()`
- `assertNotEquals()`
- `assertThat()`


# Mockito is a Java framework that allows us to mock the functionality of other methods

This allows for black box testing
- Where you don't know the functionality of the given module, we just need valid out from it
- This is extremely useful for testing methods that rely on the output of other methods
- You replace the dependency of the other method with mocks and stubs

A Stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values

A Mock is a fake class that be examined after the test is finished to see how it interacted with the class under the test

## Mocking Objects in Mockito

Mockito uses Annotations to implement its mocking, to mock an object you put `@Mock` above it

- Mocking an object gives you the ability to prevent the object from doing something, and you get to tell it what to do instead
- This is useful when one peice of code relies on another module, you can have a garenteed return from the depedent module by using mocking

If you have an object that requires other modules, you can use `@InjectMocks` above the object to give it the dependencies needed

Finally, to be sure the mocking is going to work, you will need to enable Mockito annotationas, to do this you create a mehod to run before every test, and inside call `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)`

## Spying With Mockito

Spying in Mockito allows you to watch specific methods of class to be called, if the methods you are spying on are called you can override the logic to the method

This is useful for testing to be sure you don't make database calls

## Testing for exceptions using Junit

In Junit you can test to see if an exception was thrown by using `@Test(expected = Exception.class)

If you use the above convention, the method being test MUST throw that exception, otherwise the test will fail

# Git flow and Branching Strategies

Git flow is a workflow designed by Vincent Driessen and nvie, and its a robust framework for managing large projects by defining strict branching models design around project releases

The official way to use it is to use their command line tool
- On windows this is preinstalled, and can be run by using `git flow init`
- On Mac you must install it with `brew install git-flow` then run the above

You don't neccessarily need to use the command line tool, it is more about the idea of following a strict branching convention

Typical branches you will see with this work flow are:
- The main branch should hold the current production build of your app
- The development branch holds the code that will be merged into the main branch upon next release
- Features branches branch off of the development branch, and hold the more experimental code of individual features during development
    - Each one of these branches, would eventually be merged back into the development branch
- The hotfix branch is used for emergency fixes, that will need to be merged directly into the main branch upon the issue being fixed

## Merging and Merge Conflicts

It is best practice to NOT merge your code automatically, rather you should create pull requests on Github, or whatever remote repo service you are using.

When you create a pull request, this will essentially signify that the feature you are working is done, and ready for a code review. Then someone can review your code, and when it okayed, it will be merged

To create a pull request, go to the repo on Github > Choose the Pullrequests tab > Click on the green new pull request button

A merge conflict may occur if the same file was updated by two different developers.

Typically this will make it impossible to merge automatically until you manually open the files with your text editor and choose which version of the file you want to keep.

## Protecting Branches on Github

You can protect your repository branches on Github by going into the settings of the Repository

Under the branch section, as long as the repository is public, you can setup whatever rules you would like, to which ever branch specified
