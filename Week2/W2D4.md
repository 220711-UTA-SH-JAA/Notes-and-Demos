# Generics

Are constructs in Java which enforce compile time type safety by allowing you to use paremeterized types

- These are heavily used with Collections API

They are essentially place holders for a future datatype that helps us enforce type safety

Generics can be delcared on a class, method parameters, or return types

With generics you can restrict a class to only accept objects of a given type and the compiler will prevent you from using those other types

To make a class or interface generic, use angled brackets `ClassName<T>` when declaring it, and use an arbitrary "generic type" which is determined when invoking the code

Naming conventions for Generics:
- E => Element
- K => Map key
- V => Map Value
- N => Number
- T => Generic

# Data Structures

An object used to efficiently store and access data
- Some prioritzie data access, some prioritize data modification

There are many different types of data structures, typically one does some specific task every well

Our two main types of data structures are Linear and Hierarchical:

## Linear Data Structures:

Arranges data in an orderly manner where each item is attached adjacently
- All elements can be accessed in a single run
- These are typically easier/simplier to implement
- Have single level
- Are memory infficient

Linear Data structures include:
- Lists
- Sets
- Stacks
- Queues
- Maps

## Hierarchical Data Structures

Arranges elements in some sorted order, or they have some relationship other that just a sequence of elements
- Cannot be accessed in a single runtime
- More complex to implement
- Multi-leveled
- Memory Efficient

Hierarchical Data structures include:
- Maps
- Graphs
- Trees
- Heaps

# Data structure Team Research Assignment

Present/Report on:
- What is your data structure?
- Are there different ways to implement it? If so what are they?
- What is your data structure useful for:
    - Where would want to use them vs where are they not useful
    - Are their certain implementations of your data structure that are better than certain things

Implentation

- What version/implentation of that data structure did you go for?
- How did you implement it?
- What are the most basic methods needed to access/store/delete elements from your structure
    - How do you go about adding or deleting elements?

## Breakout room one: ArrayList

## Breakout room two: LinkedList

## Breakout room three: Priority Queue

## Breakout room four: Deque (Doubled Ended Queue)

The Collection API is a framework of classes and interfaces in Java that implement the most 
commonly used data structures

**ALMOST** every class in the collection API extends the Iterable interface

- Exception is the Map class

# Iterable and Iterator Interfaces

## Iterable interface

define data structures that can be directly traversed using the .iterator() method

## Iterator Interface:

contains methods for traversing linear data structures, these include methods like:
- hasNext()
- next()
- remove()

Any class that implements Iterable can also be used with enhanced for loops

Classes that implement the Iterable interface also have the .forEach() method, which allows users to iterate through the data structure and perform some logic a lambda expression

# Implementation of the Collection Interfaces

## Lists

The most basic datatype, a collection of ordered data, the order is preserved

- Duplicate entries are allowed
- Elements are accessed by their index, which starts at 0

ArrayList: a class which implements the List interface, and contains an array inside of
- The array is resizable, once it reaches the max capacity it increases in size by 50%
- You can traverse it quickly via index
- Insertion and deletion is slower, because it may have to resize the internal array

LinkedList: a class which implements the List and Queue interface which is composed of nodes that refernse one another
- Insertion and deletion is relatively quick
- Retrieving a specific index will be slower, because we have to traverse all the way to that index

Vector: an older class which implements the List interface, which is a threadsafe ArrayList
- Double the array when more space is needed

Stack: an older class which implements the List interface, used to implement the stack data structure
- But now we typically use a Deque

## Sets

A collection of data that is NOT ordered and it does NOT contain duplicates
- does not preserve the order in which elements are inserted

HashSet: a class which implements the Set interface and is backed by a Hashmap
- There is no ordering when iterating
- Allows one null value
- Allows fast insertion and traversal

TreeSet: a class which implements the Set interface which maintain sorted order when the elements are inserted
- It is backed by a sorted tree
- Insertion and deletion is slow
- It cannot contain null elements
- It needs a Comparator to know how to order the elements

## Queues

Collection of data that follows first in first out, unless otherwise specified

ArrayDeque: a class the implements the Queue and Deque interfaces, that allows programmers to have a double ended queue
- This allows us to create Stacks OR Queues with a single data structure

- It is a double ended queue
- It is going to store items in a resizable array

Useful ArrayDeque methods:
- pop()
- push()
- peekFirst()
- peekLast()
- pollFirst()
- pollLast()
- offerFirst()
- offerLast()

Priority Queue: a class which implements the Queue interface which order elements on their natural ordering
- This one also uses a Comparator

## Maps

Data structures that uses key/value pairs to store and retrieve data

The Map interface does NOT implement the Collection interface, however it is still considered part of the Collections API

You cannot iterate over a Map, because it does not implement the Iterable interface, you can iterate through different values in the map
- use the entrySet() method to iterate over the set of Map.entry
- use keySet() method to iterate over the set of keys
- use values() to return a Collection of values which can be iterated over

HashMap: a class which implements the Map interface
- Stores elements in a key/value pair
- Intersetion and retrieval
- Tradeoff is that it does not maintain insertion order
- Permits one null key, and mulitple null values

TreeMap: a class which implements the Map interface
- Stores its keys in a tree structure
- Insertion and retrieval is slower
- Cannot contain null keys

HashTable: an older class which implements the Maps interface
- Cannot contain null keys or null values

# Comparable and Comparator Interfaces

## Comparable

an interface which defines the natural ordering for class/objects

- The class must implement the Comparable interface and implement the compareTo() method

The compareTo() method should return:
- 0 if the two objects are equal
- \<0 if "this" object is smaller than the one passed into the parameter list
- \>0 if "this" object is larger than the one passed into the parameter list

## Comparator

an interface that allows you to define total ordering on some collection of objects
- You can implement the Comparatyor interface, but are not required to implement the .compare() method

# collections vs Collection vs Collections
- collections are just a collection of entities
- Collection is the interface within the Collections API
- Collections is a utility class that has static convient methods that operate on data structures in the Collections API
