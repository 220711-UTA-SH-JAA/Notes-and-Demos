	 * - Belongs to the object
	 * - Each individual object derived from a class could have a different value for this variable
	 * - While the object exists in memory, instance scope variables are available to the program
	 * 
	 * Static Scope
	 * - Belongs to the class itself
	 * - If change the value in one object instance of the class, it will change across all object instances of the class
	 * - While this scope is sort of special, it exists for the same amount of time as the instance scope
