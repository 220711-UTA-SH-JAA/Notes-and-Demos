	 * In Java Strings are an object derived from the String class
	 * 
	 * String stores a sequence of characters as its state
	 * - You cannot change/modify the state/content of a string once it is set, this means that it is immutable
	 * - If you want to change the value of a string, you must create it completely with the new data
	 * 
	 * String have many methods, that help us out in finding out info about the string/working on the string
	 * - The String methods WILL NOT actually modify the String, they will return a NEW STRING
	 * - charAt(index)
	 * - concat(String str)
	 * - indexOf(char ch)
	 * - length()
	 * - subString(int start, int end)
	 * - contains(String str)
