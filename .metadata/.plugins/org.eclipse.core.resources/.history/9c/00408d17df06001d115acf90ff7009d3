	 * In Java Strings are an object derived from the String class
	 * 
	 * String stores a sequence of characters as its state
	 * - You cannot change/modify the state/content of a string once it is set, this means that it is immutable
	 * - If you want to change the value of a string, you must create it completely with the new data
	 * 
	 * String have many methods, that help us out in finding out info about the string/working on the string
	 * - The String methods WILL NOT actually modify the String, they will return a NEW STRING
	 * - charAt(index)
	 * - concat(String str)
	 * - indexOf(char ch)
	 * - length()
	 * - subString(int start, int end)
	 * - contains(String str)
	 * 
	 * Strings a so special that they get their own special space in the program memory
	 * - They so they used so often, we store them somewhere that will prevent duplicates to memory
	 * 
	 * This place is called the String pool
	 * - There are no duplicates
	 * - Any string literal that does exist in the string pool already will be placed there
	 * - And string literal that already exists, will point to the string in the string pool
	 *
