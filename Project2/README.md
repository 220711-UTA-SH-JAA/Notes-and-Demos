## Project Technology:

You must build the serverside of your projects with Java 8

To aid you in creating the serverside, you are allowed to use the additional technologies as we learn them:
- Hibernate ORM/Spring ORM
- Spring/Spring MVC

You must build a frontend user interface to make requests to your serverside application
- Use HTML/CSS/JS to create this user interface, I expect the user interface to be styled and look nice
- If you want, you are allowed to use Angular, however this is not a requirement, because there will only be approximately a week for you to implement an Angular front end

## For Requirements and Presentation Information please refer to the document linked above
