# Lombok

Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java. You will never have to write another getter, or equals method gain, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, automate your logging variables, and much more.

Lomboks goals is to reduce boilerplate code by generating it at runtime, this includes:

-   Getters and Setters
-   No Arg Constructors
-   toString methods
-   equals
-   hascode
-   logging variables

# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source Spring Framework project used to rapidly create Java based, production-grade applications utilizing Spring Frameworks IOC and module intregrations.

Spring Boot simplifies project created because it allows you to pick and choose which Spring Frameworks you want to use, and configures them for you

Spring Boot has a built-in Tomcat server, and you don't have to map and servlets for web applications

To enable auto configuration you just need to annotate your driver class with @SpringBootApplication

-   This is a combination of
    -   @SpringBootConfiguration
    -   @EnabledAutoConfiguration
    -   @ComponentScan

You can also override/customize configurations using the application.properties file

# Spring Boot DevTools

Spring Boot DevTools implements two useful features:

-   Cache Disabling: cache is helpful in production, but can hinder development workflow, DevTools automatically disables caching
-   Automatic restarts: anytime you make a change to your application, the development server will restart for you

# Spring Data
### Spring Data is not a core spring frameworks

### It is family of frameworks for ORM and data persistance whos main purpose is abstract away required for data storage. Allows us to focus on business logic

We are specifically learning Spring Data JPA

It essentially abstracts away the use of hibernate and SpringORM, simplifying your Data Access Layer and providing standard implementations for common DAO methods

This means you no longer have to implement these, they are simply provided for you extending the JpaRepository

When you extend JpaRepository Spring will automatically create an implementation for youe DAO, include CRUD for standard data access, as custom queries based off of method signatures.

## Spring Data JPA Interface Hieracrchy

![JPA Repository](springdatajrepositories.png)

## Spring Data JPA Features

-   Building sophisicated repositories based on Spring and JPA
-   Support for QueryDSL predicates and type-safe JPA queries
    -   This is less importatant/probably won't use it. But, QueryDSL is a framework which enables statically typed SQL-like queries instead of requiring inline string queries or XML.
-   Transparent auditing of Domain classes
-   Pagination support
-   Dynamic Query Execution
-   Support for integration of custom data access code
-   Automatic custom queries
-   Valididation of @Query annotated queries during bootstrapping
-   Support of XML based entity mapping
-   JavaCongig based repository configuration by introducing `@EnableJpaRepositories`

## Spring Data JPA Methods

-   Comes with predefined methods

    -   https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html
    -   Primarily CRUD operations

-   You also create custom method signatures to find almost anything you want:

    -   https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.5.0.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html
    -   Take a look at table 2.3 in about linkg for above examples
    -   When Spring Data crates a new Repository Implementation, it ananlyses all of the methods defined in the interfaces, and attempts to automatically generate queries from method names. It has limitations, but it is also very powerful and elegant way of defining new custom access methods with very little effort.

-   You can also use @Query to write JPA queries, and use QueryDSL as stated above
    -   You may end using the @Query annotations on rare occasions

## Spring Data Annotations

A quick run down of the different Spring Data Annotations

| Annotation                      | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @Transactional                  | Configure how the database transaction behaves (Kevin will cover this next)               |
| @NoRepositoryBean               | Creates an interface that provides common methods for child repositories                  |
| @Param                          | Parameters can be passed to queries defined with @Query                                   |
| @Transient                      | Mark a field as transient, to be ignored by the data store engine during reads and writes |
| @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy     | Auditing annotations that will automatically be filled with the current principal         |
| @CreatedDate, @LastModifiedDate | Auditing annotations that will automatically fill with current date                       |
| @Query                          | Supply a JPQL query for repository methods                                                |

# @Transactional

When we are interacting with databases through Java we should expect that multiple transactions will be performed simultaneously

With @Transactional we can allow Spring Data to manage these transactions for us to prevent issues with very litle added code

It is best practice to use @Transactional on your @Service classes since this is where the actual queries occur

@Transactional attributes:

| Attribute              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isolation              | The transaction isolation level.                                                                                                                                        |
| noRollbackFor          | Defines zero (0) or more exception Classes, which must be subclasses of Throwable, indicating which exception types must not cause a transaction rollback.              |
| noRollbackForClassName | Defines zero (0) or more exception names (for exceptions which must be a subclass of Throwable) indicating which exception types must not cause a transaction rollback. |
| propagation            | The transaction propagation type.                                                                                                                                       |
| readOnly               | A boolean flag that can be set to true if the transaction is effectively read-only, allowing for corresponding optimizations at runtime.                                |
| rollbackFor            | Defines zero (0) or more exception classes, which must be subclasses of Throwable, indicating which exception types must cause a transaction rollback.                  |
| rollbackForClassName   | Defines zero (0) or more exception names (for exceptions which must be a subclass of Throwable), indicating which exception types must cause a transaction rollback.    |
| timeout                | The timeout for this transaction (in seconds).                                                                                                                          |
| transactionManager     | A qualifier value for the specified transaction.                                                                                                                        |

# Transaction Propagation Strategies

When accessing Databases with Java it is common that you may have one service method call apon another service method, these Transaction Propagation Strategies describe how spring should manage these situations

|   Strategy    | Purpose                                                                                              |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Mandatory   | Support a current transaction, throw an exception if none exists.                                    |
|    Nested     | Execute within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists, behave like REQUIRED otherwise. |
|     Never     | Execute non-transactionally, throw an exception if a transaction exists.                             |
| Not Supported | Execute non-transactionally, suspend the current transaction if one exists.                          |
|   Required    | Support a current transaction, create a new one if none exists.                                      |
| Requires New  | Create a new transaction, and suspend the current transaction if one exists.                         |
|   Supports    | Support a current transaction, execute non-transactionally if none exists.                           |

# Validation

Spring Validator interface is used to validate objects. The interface works by using Spring Framework Errors objects, so that while validating, validators can report these validation failures to this Errors object

Spring Errors Interface stores and exposes information about data-binding and validation errors for objects

Spring Errors also can output message by using MessageSource
