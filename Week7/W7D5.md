# Lombok

This is a java library/plugin that is installed into your ide, it "spices up" java. It takes away the need to write getters, setters, constructors, and other boiler plate type code.

It generates these different pieces of code at runtime
- Getters and Setters
- No Args and All Args Constructors
- toString Methods
- equals
- hashcode
- logging variables

This is done through the use of annotations

To intsall follow the directions at the website:

# Spring Boot Actuator

Is Spring plugin/library, that exposes tools for monitoring and gathering metrics about your application

It generates endpoints for you application to view different information:
- /health
- /beans
- /env
- /info
- /logfile
- /loggers
- /mapping
- /metrics
- /shutdown

To configure which of these endpoints are active you enable them/disable them in the application.properties

# Spring Boot Profiles / Dynamic Environment Configuration

Spring Boot profiles allow us to map beans to different profiles, such that we have different versions of beans, possibly for different environments

This might be useful, to have some production repository bean, that interacts with the production database
- Then you could have a dev repository bean which interacts with a dev database
- Then you could have a testing repository bean which interacts with some testing database

# Spring Validator

Spring Validator is an interface for validating objects. We can look into some object, and make sure that all the properties meet some criteria.
- The property can't be empty
- The property can't be negative
- The property can't be too big
- The property must adhere to some pattern

If the validation fails, the custom validator class will return some Errors Objects (this is not like an exception, it is a special class from the Spring framework reporting the object is not object)

Spring Errors interface stores and exposes information about data-binding and validation errors for objects

Spring Errors also can output messages by using MessageSource class/interface

# Making HTTP Requests with Java

We use RestTemplate, to make web requests from a java/spring application

RestTemplate acts as a webclient to make requests to webservices, it offers three different methods to make these requets

- get/postForEntity()
- get/postForObject()
- exchange()
