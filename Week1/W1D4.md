# First Java Program

Break down each part of the following program

```java
class HelloJava{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}
```

# Class vs Object

## Classes

Our Java applications are going to broken up into files that contain classes

Classes layout exactly layout extactly what our objects are going to contain, both state wise, and behavior wise.

You can think of classes like a blue print for an object in Java
- We use these classes to do what is called instantiating our objects

## Objects

That means that an object is an instance of a class

Objects in Java are what we use to model real world objects, typically things described as a noun (person, places, or things)

The Java objects have a name, states (attributes), and behaviors
- The objects states and behviors are sometimes referred to as class members
- The name of the object will come from its class name

# Methods and Parameters

## Methods

How java objects get their behaviors

A method is a named block of code declared inside of a class
- Otherwise known as a function attached to an object

## Rules for Java methods

Must be declared inside of a class declaration

Must have a return type, if the method returns nothing, you denote it as returning `void`

Must have a name, followed by parenthesis
- Optionally, you can include parameters to the function inside of the method parenthesis

The start and end of the method logic are denoted by curly braces
- This can also be referred to as the code block

### The `return` keyword is used when a method as an associated return type, to return a value

## Parameters

Parameters are values passed to a method, to either operate on, or be used inside of the method logic
- If you create a method which takes in parameters, when you call that method later, you must pass those paremeters, otherwise it will result in a compilation error
- You may pass as many parameters to a method as you like, you just must separate them by commas

## Passing Values to Methods

Java uses pass by value when passing variables into methods

-   Meaning that a copy of the value is passed into the method, the original value will not be modified

However when passing objects things get weird:

When objects are stored in variables, the variable is a "pointer" or "reference" to the object in memory.

So when object references are passed to methods, it is not possible to change the reference itself, because the value of the reference is passed.

Var args is a notation in java to pass an unset amount of parametes of a single datatype
- Uses the `...` notation
- There can only be one varargs in a method, and it MUST be the last parameter
- Varargs gets converted to an array behind the scenes (more on arrays later)
- `method(int ... values){}`

## The `main` method

A special method in Java which the JRE calls to run the application
- Its called main because thats what the developers of Java decided to call it
- It will always have the same exact syntax, so remember it
    - `public static void main(String[] args)`
- When you run a `.class` file with the `java` command, it will need the main method inside of it, otherwise Java will not know how to run the file

# Arrays and Array Indexing Strategies

An object which stores elements of the same data type
- The elements are stored via index, in an array each index is located next to one another in memory
- Array indexes start at 0, you access specific elemnts in the array by these indexes
- The array must be given a size when instantiated, and you cannot resize
- The `length` property gives programmers access to the size of the array

There are multiple ways to declare an array
- `datatype arr[]`
- `datatype[] arr`

There are multiple ways to instantiate an array
- `datatype arr[] = new datatype[size]`
- `int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}`;

Arrays are considered objects, meaning we can store arrays inside of arrays, making multideminsional arrays

- These can be used to model matrixes, and be used to solve dynmic programming problem

To create a multiple dimensional array, we just add more square brackets

- `datatype[][] arr`

The first set of indexes in our multi-dimensional array are storing arrays
- Theses are similar to rows and columns
- `dataType[row][col] arr`

# Java Variables and Syntax

Variables are objects in Java get their states

Java is a statically typed programming language like we previously mentioned, so enable to declare a variable you must first declare its type

After its type you give it a name, or what you would like to refer to it as

And finally, you assign the variable a value

The syntax looks like this: `type name = value`
- Once the datatype is set, it cannot be changed

In Java there are two types of data we could assign to a variable, Primitive and Reference

## Primitive Datatypes

Primitives are the most basic building blocks of java code, these include numberic and character data types

| Datatype | Bits           | Min and Max Vals      |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| boolean  | 1 bit          | true or false         |
| byte     | 8 bits         | -128 to 127           |
| short    | 16 bits        | -32,768 to 32,767     |
| int      | 32 bits        | -2^31 to 2^31-1       |
| long     | 64 bits        | -2^63 to 2^63-1       |
| float    | 32 bit decimal | -1.4^45 to 3.40^38    |
| double   | 64 bit decimal | -4.9^329 to 1.79 ^308 |
| char     | 16 bit unicode |                       |

## Reference Datatypes

Reference data types are objects that are referenced in the memory allocated to our program
- Arrays
- Strings
- Custom objects

## Casting

We can change/comvert the datatype of a variable to a different datatype with casting
- Widening, can and will occur automatically in java, taking a smaller datatype and storing in one with more bits
	- This is why we must explicitly tell java we want to store bytes and shorts
- Narrowing, will again occur automatially with long, but can also be attempted with others, this is taking a datatype with more bits and storing/converting it to a datatype with less bits
	- You must be careful, you could try to store a value too large into a datatype that is smaller

## Java Default Values

In java when you create a variable, if you do not explicitly give it a value right away it be instaniated with a default value
- Numberics: 0 or 0.0
- Boolean: false
- char: \u0000
- Reference/objects: null

# Wrapper Classes

The only thing keeping Java from being perfectly Object Oriented is the fact that primitive datatypes exist, since these are not derived from classes

To push Java to a more Object Oriented language Wrapper Classes were introduced

For each Primitive datatype there is a Java Wrapper class with the same name but capitalized
- These allow us to treat primitives as object
- Useful later in training when we get to more advanced data storage options
- Come with useful methods for the corresponding datatype

| Primitive | Wrapper Class |
|-----------|---------------|
| boolean   | Boolean       |
| byte      | Byte          |
| short     | Short         |
| char      | Character     |
| int       | Integer       |
| long      | Long          |
| float     | Float         |
| double    | Double        |

Autoboxing: when you pass a primitive argument into a parameter that asks for its Wrapper equivalent, Java will automatically wrap the primitive into its wrapper form

Unboxing: when you passed a wrapper object into a parameter that asks for a primitive, Java will automatically convert the wrapper object to a primitive value

# Constructors

Up to this point, we have been able to design Classes in java to describe objects with
- states/attributes using variables that have a datatype and value associated with them
- behaviors using methods which have some return type, a name, optional parameters and logic

But we have no way of creating objects/instantiating an object from those classes

To create an instance of an object from a class we must create a constructor, and call it using the `new` keyword

Constructors are special methods in Java which are used to initialized instances of objects
- They don't have a return type
- Share the name of the class being created
- We can give them specific values to set inside of our object

Ever class in Java implicitly gets given a constructor at run time, this is what we consider the default contructor
- The default constructor will set all of your class memberss to their default state

There are also two other types of constructors
- The no argument constructor
- Parameterized Constructor

No argument constructor is simply a constructor a programmer physically writes, but takes no arguments
- It is NOT the same as the default

Parameterized is a constructor the programmer physically writes, but takes in arguments

- The `this` keyword is often used inside of paremeterized constructors to set variables that belong to the specific object we are creating

If you explicitly created ANY constructor inside of your class, the default constructor will no longer be generated at runtime

You can have one constructor in a class, call another constructor in the same class by using the `this()`, this is called constructor chaining.

Every constructor will call the `super()` keyword, whether explicitly added or not. 
- If you explicity write `super()` it MUST be the first line of the constructor
- More on the `super()` keyword once we get to practical inheritance

# Adding logic to our Programs

Our programs can only store data at the moment, we have no way of doing anything real useful
- We use Operators and Control Flow Statements to add this logic

## Java Operators

Operators apply some logic to the values stored in our variables

Java has many types of operators, here are some the important ones:

- Arithmetic: +, -, \*, /, %
- Relational: <, > , <=, >=
- Equality: ==, !=
- Bitwise: &, |, ^
- Logical Operators: &&, ||
    - Logical operators can short circuit
        - If the result of the operation can be determined by looking at the first half of the expressions, it will return without looking at the second half
- Ternary: `expression ? true : false`
- Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Postfix: x++, x--
    - Postfix operations evaluate the value in the variable, then after whatever evaluation is done, it will increment/decrement the value
- Prefix: ++x, --x:
    - Prefix operations increment/decerment the value, then do whatever evaluation is needed

## Java Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements can break up the normal flow of our application

Two main types of control flow statements in java
- Loops
- Branching

Loops are used to perform some logic repeatedly until a certain condition is met

### Loops types in Java:

For loops will loop a set number of times
- `for(looping variable; looping condition; loop increment;){}`
- Set a variable at a starting point, then you loop until you have reaced the looping condition
- `for(int i=0; i<4; i++){}`

While loop will loop while a condition is true
- `while(condition){}`
- while loops can be more dynamic because instead of looping a set number of times, you loop until you decide the condition should be false
- Be careful because you can cause an infinite loop

Do-While loop, are similar to while loops, except they will run at least once, even if the looping condition is false
- ```java
    do{
        logic
    } while(condition)
  ```

### The `continue` keyword can be used with loops to break out of the current iteration, and start again at the top of the loop
You can only use the continue keyword inside of a loop

Branching statements allow us to check for equality and decide to go to a different branch of code depending on the result

### Branching/Conditional Statements in Java

If statements are the most basic branching statement
- `if(condition){logic}`
- if the condition is true, we will run the code the following block
- if the condition is false, we will skip over the block, and continue down our code

Else statements accompany the if statement, these are blocks of code to be run if the if statment is false

- ```java
  if(condition){
      if logic
  } else {
      else logic
  }
  ```

If/else if, is used if you have multiple conditions you want to check for

- ```java
  if(condition){

  }
  else if(another condition){

  }
  else {

  }
  ```

Switch statements are similar to if/else if statements. You give the switch block a value to read, then define cases to match on the given variable
- The input to the switch block is allowed to be: String, char, byte, short, int, Enum
- You must use a break statement or a return statement in each case, otherwise your code could run through and run multiple cases
- You can/should also include a `default` case incase the input does not match any given case
- ```java
  switch(month){
      case "January":
        return 1;
      case ...
      .
      .
      .
  }

### The `break` keyword can be used in branching and looping operations, to break out of the current block of code
