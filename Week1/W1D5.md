# Packages and imports

Packages are a way for programmers to group together like classes
- Typically forming some sub module of the the application

Packages are litterally just folders with java code inside of them, many development environments, and project managers create packages for you

If you want to create a package manually:
- First create the folder structure that you desire
- The very first line of the java file must include the keyword `package` followed by the full structure of the package

To create a package:

1. Compile the file like normal

2. Compile the file with -d `javac -d . file.java`

3. This will create the package for you

Packages should follow a lowercase, reverse domain naming convention
- `com.revature.package`

The upside of using packages, is it allows us to also import other classes into our code
- When you use the `import` keyword, java will import the class into any other class
    - `import com.revaure.package.classname`
- You can also import any entire package
    - `import com.revature.package`
- There are also static import which allow you to use methods from classes without creating an object of that class
    - `import static com.revature.package.classname`
    - More on the static keyword next week

# SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

Outlines the process to plan, create, test and deploy information systems and applications

## SDLC Follows these 7 general steps:

1. Requirements Phase
2. Analysis Phase
3. Design Phase
4. Development Phase
5. Testing Phase
6. Integration and Deployment Phase
7. Maintenance Phase

There are two main approaches to SDLC:
- Waterfall
- Agile

## WaterFall

Waterfall is a linear approach, as you finish one phase, you move onto the next, and there is no going back

## Typical Timeline of Waterfall

- Requirements: 2-4 weeks
- Planning/Analysis: 2-4 weeks
- Design: 1-4 months
- Implementation/Development: 6-12+ months
- Testing: 6 month, but actually ongoing
- Deployment: 1-3 weeks
- Maintenance: lifetime of the application

## Advantages of Waterfall
- Easy to manage workflow
- Well suited for small teams, or short term projects, that will not require any requirement changes
- Gernerally it will result in faster delivery
- Process and results are easily documented
- Easy to adapt to shifting teams since the steps are clearly laid

## Disadvantages of Waterfall
- Very inflexible and ineffiecient
- Not ideal for large team projects
- Testing does not begin until development is complete

## Agile

Agile is a iterative approach, you go through every step of SDLC in 2-4 week sprints

Agile is ideology, not a concrete SDLC methodoloy

Agile is becoming the more widely accepted and utilize method of SDLC because of its core values

- Indivuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working sotfware over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Advantages of Agile

- Client collaboration is generally regarded as positive
- Agile team cultires tend to stay more self-organized and motivated
- Overall quality of product is normally higher because of the iterative approach
- Less risk in development process due to the incremental approach

## Disadvantages

- Not as useful for small development projects
- Higher costs associate with the Agile workflow
- Development time can bloat if managed poorly, or requirements are not clear
- Requires more experience members during the planning and management of projects

# Agile/Scrum Concepts

Scrum is the simplest Agile Framework/implementation of Agile, it enforces ceremonies lead by a leader who ensures the team is following Scrum practices

## Scrum Artifacts:
- Product Owner: holds the authority over the project, a represtentative of the client/customer
- Scrum Master: the person who mediates all of the meeting, and goes between the client and the team (team leader)
- Project Backlog: holds all the current requirements for the project
- Sprint Backlog: requirements that we want to complete during this sprint
- User Stories: individual requirements
- Epic: a group of related features that is broken down into multiple user stories
- Sprint: a brief period of development (between 2 to 4 weeks) which generally cumulates in a release of related features
- Velocity: the sum of story points of all user stories completed that sprint

## Story Pointing

Story pointing allows teams to keep track of the progess (velocity) of their project/sprint, and create burndown charts

Burndown Charts: chart of the amount of stort points that have been completed each day vs the number of points remaining

![burndown](https://www.worldofagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ReleaseBurnDown.png)

What you would do, is when creating your user stories, you would apply points to each depending on difficult/trivial your felt each one is

When assigning story points, it should be a team discussion, that includes consideration of Risk, Complexity, and Repetition of the user story

Couple of ways to assign story points:
1. Stat poker
2. Using fib sequence
    - 1: trivial
    - 2: easy
    - 3: medium
    - 5: difficult...

## Scrum Ceremonies

meetings used during the life cycle of the sprint in the project

Sprint Planning:
- Include the entire dev team, scrum master, and product owner
- Happen once before every new sprint
- Determine the scope, goals, and metrics of the sprint

Daily Standup/Scrums:
- This is a daily meeting lead by the scrum master
- Takes aprox. 15 minutes
- Everyone tells what they are working on, what they might be stuck on, and what their goals are for the day

Sprint Review:
- Everyone is invited to this meeting
- Review what the team accomplished at the end of the sprint
- Gain feedback

Sprint Retrospective:
- Scrum master reviews metric, and assess any ineffiencies
- Plans to make improvements as a team
