In the folder of the current week I will be providing an overview of some of the activities for the day/week and questions that may be pop up in interviews

# Computer Foundatations

## (Discussion) What is a computer?

## Main Components

Central Processing Unit (CPU):
- The brains of the computer
- Processes the request sent from elsewhere
- Talks to other compontents in the PC through the motherboard

Mother Board
- The nervous system of the computer
- Hundreds of thousands of wires connecting the CPU to different components of the computer
- How the user connects their IO devices to the computer
- Sends the IO information to the CPU through its many wires
- Allows the CPU to access the different memories

Memory

- Registers/Caches on CPU
- Physical places to store VERY small peices of information on a CPU
    - Typically the byte address of some information in memory

- Random Access Memory (RAM)
    - Used to store information being used directly by the CPU, including data, programs, and program results
    - Ram allows for quick reads and writes
    - All data is lost when the computer is powered off
    - Relatively small in size (compared to harddrives)
    - Dynamic Random Access Memory
        - RAM that is continually refreshed in order to maintain the data
        - Used for most typical system memory because of its cheap costs
    - Static Random Access Memory
        - RAM that is retains its content until the power is lost
        - Used for memory caches because of its more expensive components

- Storage Memory
    - Harddrives/SSD's
    - Cheapest forms of storage
    - Slower than RAM
    - Data is persisted through power cycles

## OS: Foundations

What is an operating System?
- Software that makes it easier for users to interact with their computer
    - It is a intermediary between the user of the computer and the computers hardware
    - In charge of executing the programs a user asks the computer to run
- The Operating System also acts as a manager to the resources available in the computer
    - Process management, what process should the cpu focus on running, and which ones should use less resources because they are in the background?
    - Storage management, where are all my files?
    - Memory management, does the CPU still need the data stored in that RAM stick? No? Lets clear that out
    - Security and Privacy, password managers, and checking for viruses

Why do we have operating systems?

1. Convience: Makes the computer more convient to use
2. Efficiency: Allows the systems resources to be used effiecently
3. Ability to evolve: The OS is structured in a way that permits effective development, testing, and introduction to new system functions at the same time without interferring with service
4. Throughput: The OS is constructed so that it can give the maximum number of tasks per unit time

# Unix

Unix is an open source family of operating systems that was developed in AT&T's Bell lab in the early 1970's,

Originally a small terminal based OS with hierarchical file system, computer processes, and device files, the Unix family is now a giant tree of hundreds of OS's including Mac OS, and Linux

The original Unix used a shell called sh, in 1989 a new shell system was created for Unix called the Bourne Again Shell aka bash, and this is the terminal that all modern Unix based systems is built upon

## Linux

Linux is probably the most well known Unix based operating system outside of MacOS

Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, with support and constant updates from the open source community

Now there are many distrubitions of Linux, popular ones include Ubuntu, RedHat, Arch and more

-   Ubuntu is a great first time Linux distrobution, which is easy to understand and pick up for beginners
-   RedHat is an enterprise distribution that is NOT open source, it has great resources and is used by many companies using linux development environments
-   Arch is a highly customizable distribution that advanced Linux users can leverage to get the EXACT computing experience that they are looking for

## Basic Unix Commands

To understand Linux commands you must first understand the file structure of the linux OS, Linux uses a tree like file system with the `root` directory of the system mapping to the `/` character

The `home` directory where user specific information is stored is denoted by the `~`

Another important note with the unix file structure is that everything in Unix is considered a file, even directories. This knowledge will come in handy later on

## Command Arguments and Flags

Commands can be modified with either arguments or flags

Arguments are given to a command after the command in the form of a string eg `command arg1 arg2...` Arugments are typically variables that your command is expecting to use during execution

Flags are denoted by either a `-` followed by a letter, which is the shorthand, or a `--` and the flag name which is the long hand, flags are special built in arguments for the command. Flags are options you can enable for your command

### Most important command `man`

The manual command will print to the terminal the manual for using a particular command. If you are unsure what flags or arguments a command takes, you simply type `man command`. For example, if you wished to see the manual for the copy command, you would issue the command: `man cp`

### Change Directory `cd`

The change directory command allows us to navigate to a different directory on the drive.

Show these examples in GitBash:
-   go to root directory: `cd /`
-   go to home directory: `cd` or `cd ~`
-   navigate one directory up: `cd ..`
-   navigate into the `hi` directory, which is inside the `bye` directory: `cd ./bye/hi`
-   change to the previous directory: `cd -`

### Listing Files in a directory `ls`

The list directory command allows us to see the contents of a particular directory. When given no arguments, it lists the contents of the 8 current directory.

Show these examples in GitBash:
-   `-a` flag allows you to see hidden items in the directory.
-   list the contents of the current directory: `ls`
-   list the contents of the `hi` directory: `ls hi` or `ls ./hi`

### Make a new directory `mkdir`

The make directory command allows us to create a new directory. mkdir takes an argument representing the name of the directory you wish to create.

### Print the current directory `pwd`

The print working directory command prints the full name of the directory you are currently working in.

### Super User Do `sudo`

The `sudo` command allows you to run a particular command as the root user.

### Create a file `touch`

the touch command allows you to modify the timestamp of a file. This command is usually used to create empty files, as an empty file is created if touch is given a file name that does not exist.

### Print the contents of a file `cat`

### Copy the contents of a file to another file `cp`, or the contents of a directory `cp -r`

Show these examples in GitBash:
- copy a `hello.txt` to `goodbye.txt`: `cp hello.txt goodby.txt`
- copy the `hello` directory to the `goodbye` directory: `cp -r hello goodbye`

### Move a file to `mv` or move a whole directory `mv -r`

the mv command allows you to rename, or move files to different directories

Show these examples in GitBash:
- rename a `hello.txt` to `goodbye.txt`: `mv hello.txt goodbye.txt`
- move `hello.txt` to the `goodbye` directory: `mv hello.txt goodbye/.`
- rename the `hello` directory to `goodbye`: `mv hello goodbye`

### Delete a file at a specified location `rm` delete a directory `rm -r`

You don't ever want to run `rm -rf`
