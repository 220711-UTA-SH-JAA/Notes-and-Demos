# Git Fundamentals

## Git is a version control system

It keeps track of every change ever made to a project during its lifetime

Provides a collaboration tool when working in groups

## Central vs Distributed Software Control

Central Software control (CSC) has the entire project stored in a central location with no copies allowed of the master file(s)

Distributed Software Control has a copy of all versions of the master file(s) locally on any machine this is pushed, pulled, and merged into a remote repository

Git is a Distributed Software Control System

# Git repository hosting platforms

Since git is a distributed Software Version control system we have local repositories that sync up with remote repositories. We need somewhere to store these remote repositories. Enter hosting platforms

There are many platforms that are available to be used, the most popular being GitLab, GitHub, BitBucket and more

The developers take changes from their local repositories and `push` them up to the remote repository where they they access all the code from another workstation, or other developers can `pull` in the changes to their local repository to look over the code, and even make more changes

## Git Initializing a repository

First and foremost you need to make sure that you have your git credentials configured so git bash can link your machine to your github account:

<code>
git config --global user.name gitusername
git config --global user.email gitemail@mail.com
</code>

Now to create your first local repository navigate, or open the gitbash in the folder/directory that you want to start the repository in

Once in the correct folder, you can type `git init` in the command line, this will create a .git directory to your current directory

This .git directory holds all the informations about our project versions and changes, and now that you have your local repository created, you can start making changes to your project and git will know everything that changes

# Git Basic Snapshotting

While developing projects, you will follow a work flow while using git. The typical flow is project files start in the `Working directory` these files need to be tracked. Files from the working directory are chosen to be added to the `Staging Area`, where we commit the file changes to the `Repository`. Lets take a deeper look at each step in this work flow.

When you make changes to the files in your working directory you have to tell git that you want these files tracked, to do this you use the `git status` command. This is useful to see what files were changed in your project, and which ones need to be added to gits tracking

`git status` shows untracked files in red, and prompts you to use the command `git add` to add these files to git tracking, if you don't want these files tracked you can always use `git remove`

Using the command `git add` will add the files to to `Staging Area`, the staging area is where we organize what we want to be commited to the repository at the time. Git gives developers to pick and choose the files they want to be be included in the staging area at any given time, however when getting started with git, it is common for people to just use `git add .` which will add all changed files from the working directory to be commited to the git repository

When you are happy with the staging area, you can make your commit, a commit is a snapshot of changes to your software, or you can think of a commit was a new "version" of your software. To make a commit to your local repository

To make this commit you will run the git command `git commit -m "Write a quick concise message about what you changed in this commit"

It is best practice to commit early and often, instead of making huge changes in every commit

# Git Working with remote repositories

Up to this point we have created a local repo, created and made changes to files, tracked files from our working directory into the staging area, and commited to our local repo. Now we want to store our repository onto a hosting platform, in our case we will use github

Navigate to github and login, find the `+` button to create a new repository, go through the steps of naming it, giving it a description and skip the step the final step since we are importing an existing repository

After clicking `Create repository` you will see a screen that will walk you through different situations, we will follow the option of pushing an existing repository from the command line

## Git Pushing to a remote repository

Back in our git bash we have already commited changes to our git repo, now we just need to link our local repository to our remote one on github

First run `git remote add origin linktoremoterepo` this will actually link local repo to the remote repo for you

Then run `git push -u origin main` this will push your entire project, and all the change history to a new branch called main, and set the origin to the head of that branch, aka where your project currently is in its history

Now you should be able to view all the files from the project on github, you can also look through the commits, the files you changed, and more all from the user interface of github

## Complete git flow

1. Make changes to files
2. `git status` check on the files that were changed (optional)
3. `git add files` or `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "quick meaningful message`
5. `git push origin/branchname` or `git push`

## Git Branches

Branches can be seen as separate versions of your application

Every respository has one central branch, typically called the `main` branch

Developers are also capable of creating new branches, typically to experiment or implement a new features with out affecting the working code

A general rule of git is to have your working application source code on the main branch, and to create new branches for which ever feature is being implemented.

To create a new branch you use the git command `git checkout -b branchname`
- git checkout switches to a specified branch
- the -b specifies that you are creating a new branch

To just switch to a different branch you would use `git checkout branchname`

After creating your new branch, you can add new files, and commit them like normal,
- Using `git add files` and `git commit -m "message"`

However, the first time you try to push a new branch, it only exists on your local repository, you must set the upstream branch on your hosted Github repository with the following command
- `git push --setupstream origin branchname`

After initially setting the upstream branch, you can continue to work with the normal git flow

When you are ready to push the changes on your new branch to the main branch, or some other branch you must do what is called merging

There are two ways to merge a branch

1. Using the `git merge` command
- This method is less preferred
- To accomplish this, switch the to branch you would like to merge into
    - `git checkout main`
- Then use the `git merge` command to merge whatever branch into the branch you checked out
    - `git merge someotherbranch`
    - This would take the changes from someotherbranch, and merge them into the main branch

2. Using pull requests
- This is the referred method
- You make a pull request on the git repository hosting site
- You fill out the branch you would like to merge into, and which branch to merge
- Someone typically will review the changes, and check for any merge conflicts, and give you the greenlight to merge the code

Be warry of changing the same code on two different branches, or even on the same branch on different machines, this will cause merge conflicts

You will be unable to merge the code until you fix this conflicting code. We will go into more details about merge conflicts in the coming weeks, and how to deal with them.

For now, in group projects always be sure to pull from the hosted repository often, and always remember to push your code often. No excuses for a broken computer causing you to lose code.

# Introduction to Java

## What is a program

Some set of instructions for our computer to run

- Perform some specific function for us

How do we write these programs?

## Programming Language

We can use programming languages to write more complicated applications

These languages allow us to give the program some set of instructions for the computer to run


There are a couple different levels of programming languages
- Low level languages are closest to the way computers see data
- High level languages are closest to the way humans read/write
- There is also some inbetween languages which give the advantage of being human readible, but also give the programmer the ability to manipulate physical memory on the computer

Low to high level programming spectrum

Machine language would be the lowest level, we are talking straight to the machine

Assembly would be a little bit higher, but still not completely human readible, and you have physical memory access

C Language is the true inbetween, it has the human readibilty of high level languages, but memory access and management is still done manually

Java, C#, Python, are among the highest level of programming languages, they are very human readible compared to low level languages, and they have features such as automatic memory management.

## What is Java

A programming language managed by Oracle, it is high leveled, strongly typed, and object oriented

## Why do we use Java?

Java is everywhere, according to StackOverflows developer survey is it the 3rd most used programming after removing HTML and SQL (are not programming)

It is relatively easy to learn, yet powerful enough to complete advanced tasks
- C based syntax, but removes many of the complexities of the C programming language

It is platform independent, you can write java code on any machine with any hardware and run it on a different machine with different hardware
- Write once run anywhere thanks to the compiler and the java virtual machine

It is high leveled, meaning the developer does not need to worry about memory management, or other hardware level tasks

It has automatic garbage collection

It is built around Object Oriented Programming priniciples, allowing for creation of classes and objects to be used throughout the program

## Object Oriented Programming

A programming paradigm focused on constructing objects in code based on physical objects in the world

For example: A car sittin in the drive way can be modeled as an object in a programming language

Object Oriented Programming follows four primary principles, otherwise known as the Pillars of OOP

## Pillars of Object Oriented Programming

Abstraction: Separating the implementation and the declaration of functionality in a program/object
- The idea of giving the user/programmer a list of different operations without showing them how they work

Polymorphism: Means to "take on many forms", and plays into another concept we will mention later
- This gives programmers the ability to write objects which relate, and openly switch between those objects
- It also gives programmers the freedom to write functionality with the same name, but slightly different implementation

Inheritance: Similiar to how you inherit traits from your parents, and grandparents, object oriented programming allows for objects to inherit behaviors and traits from other objects
- Inheritance goes hand and hand with polymorphism, because when you inherit from another object, you create an is-a relationship
- Inheritance enables polymorphism to be able to freely switch between different object types

Encapsulation: Hiding an objects data and or behaviors from the outside world
- This is the most straight forward pillar, you are simply making data inside of am object private to the outside world

In the next week or two we will explore extactly how these principles relate to have, however, it is important to know that these are separate from Java, and can be applied to many other languages

## Java Code Files

The Java code we write is going to live in files denoted with the `.java` extension

Java is a compiled language as we mentioned previously, so our computers cannot actually run code stored in a `.java` file

When we compile our Java it is stored in byte code inside of a `.class` file, it is best not to push these files up to github

Once we have a `.java` file how do we go about compiling and running it?

Using the Developers tools provided by Java

## Compiling and Running our Java Code

Java provides their developers with a robust set of tools to write, debug, compile and run their code.

As mentioned above, developers write their Java code in files denoted with the `.java` extension

After writing their Java code they must use the tools mentioned above from the JDK, JRE, and JVM to compile and run, lets look at each of these toolkits

## The Java Development Kit (JDK)

Contains everything needed to develop a Java application
- Including tools to debug and and compile our code
- You can find the tools included with the JDK inside of the folder where we installed Java

Inside of the JDK there is a script/command called `javac`, when run with the correct input, the command will output the bytecode we mentioned above and the associated `.class` file

The `javac` command only needs to take in the `.java` file that you are trying to compile, so the ussage will look like so: `javac hello.java` the output would be `hello.class`

The JDK also includes one more important tool, the JRE

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

Once you have that `.class` file, how are you to run it? With the Java Runtime Environment of course

The JRE contains the bare minimum libraries and utilities that you need to execute a Java programming
- including the `java` script/command, which when given a valid java `.class` file, will print the output of the program to the terminal
- The `java` command can also take in extra properties known as arguments, which we will see and talk about tomorrow.

The JRE also contains one last important peice of the Java puzzle, the JVM, or the magic behind Java's write once run anywhere nature

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

The JVM is contained within the JRE, and takes the compiled `.class` file, and converts the byte code into machine/os/hardware specific code that the silicon of your PC can understand
- This is how your program actually gets run
- The OS/Machine dependent JVM is installed when you install the correct version of Java JDK or JRE for your specific machine
- The JVM is what makes Java such a powerful programming language, and platform dependent

The JVM is also where the program memory is stored, we will go more indepth on this topic later next week.

## The Complete Java Development Process

1. Write java source code in files denoted with `.java`
2. Compile the java source code into byte code stored in `.class` files by using the JDK's `javac` command
3. Use the JRE to run the `.class` file with its `java` command, if your programm also takes in arguments, you can include them like so `java program.class arg1 arg2...`
4. The JRE calls upon the JVM, which takes the byte code from the .class file, and converts it to machine specific code that your computer can understand and run
5. The output of your java application is shown in the terminal if run successfully
