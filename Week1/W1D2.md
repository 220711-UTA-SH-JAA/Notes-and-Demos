# File permissions

The first important thing to know about Unix file permissions is that everything in Unix is considered a file, including directories

## Ownership of files

Permissions of a file are going to be dependent on the users ownership, there are three levels that every file has

1. Owner Permissions: determines what actions the owner/creator of the file can perform on said file
2. Group Permissions: determines what actions a user whos is a member of the group that a file belongs to can perform on said file
3. determines what actions anyone else on the system can perform on said file

We can view what permissions are each file by using `ls -l`

## Reading the permissions string

When using `ls -l` the command will output a large string for each file in the directory

The first part of the string is the permissions of the file
- This is a ten character long string made up of the characters d, r, w, x
    - The d may appear at the beginning of the string idicating whether the file is a directory
    - The r indicates that user can read the file
    - The w indicates that user can write to the file
    - The x indicates that user can execute (run) the file

After the first character determining whether a file is a directory, the permissions are broken into three groups of three permissions
- These three groups of people correspond with the list of groups above
    - Characters 2-4 indicate the permissions for the owner
    - Characters 5-7 indicate the permissions for the group
    - Characters 8-10 indicate the permissions for the others

As mentioned aboved, the block of three characters determines what that user can actually do with the file
- example `-rwxr-xr--` indicates:
    - That this is not a directory
    - The owner can read, write, and execute `rwx`
    - If you are part of the group you can read and execute `r-x`
    - Anyone else can read `r--`

## Changing File Permissions

You can change the permissions of a file or directory using the `chmod` command in two ways.

## The first way is by using Absolute permissions

Each permission is assigned a value, and when you use the `chmod` command you pass in the sum of each permission value to each one of the users (owner,group,other)

| Number | Octal Permission Representation              | Ref   |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| 0      | No Permission                                | `---` |
| 1      | Execute Permission                           | `--x` |
| 2      | Write Permission                             | `-w-` |
| 3      | Execute and Write: 1(execute)+2)write        | `-wx` |
| 4      | Read Permission                              | `r--` |
| 5      | Read and Execute: 4(read)+1(execute)         | `r-x` |
| 6      | Read and Write: 4(read)+2(write              | `rw-` |
| 7      | All Permissions: 4(read)+2(write)+1(execute) | `rwx` |

## Examples:

`chmod 777 file` : Sets all access to everyone on this file

`chmod 740 file` : Allows the owner all access, Group read access, everyone else nothing

## The second way is using symbolic mode

In Symbolic mode you specify which user type you want to modify the permissions for, and tell UNIX what permissions you want to add or take away
- Use the `+` to add permissions to a user
- Use the `-` to remove permissions from a user
- Use the `=` to set an exact permission for a user
- Use the `o` to specify the owner of the file
- Use the `g` to specify the group of the file
- Use the `u` to specify the other of the file

## Examples:

`chmod u-x file` : removes the ability for other users to execute
`chmod g+w file` : adds the ability for people in the group to write to the file
`chmod o=rwx file` : allows the owner full access to the file

# Command-line text editors

Command line text editors allow users to open files in the terminal and either view the contents or edit the contents

The two most popular choices for bash command line text editors are:

## vim
A more advanced text editor that can be configured to your exact liking
- Configuration files, and packages/tools others have created for vim can allow you to turn it into a fully working IDE for any programming language
- Less beginner friendly
- [Vim Beginners Guide](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim/)

## nano
A more beginner friendly version text editor that comes with most distributions of Linux
- Less powerful than vim, but easier to approach for beginners
- [Nano Beginners Guide](!https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)

# Environment Variables

Imagine the application you are writing needs some very secret credentials. You obviously don't want to put them directly inside of your code, because that means anyone with access to the code has access to the credentials.

We could use something called Environment Variables

Environment variables are values stored on your machine or server, that are accessible throughout the entire working environment.

In UNIX these values are set in the shell when it is started.

There is a environment variable in UNIX called `$HOME` which points to which ever user is signed in's home directory

If you wish to check the value store in an environment variable you can do so with the `echo` command

## There are two ways to set an environment variable on a unix based system

1. Using the `export` command in the bash
    - This will only set this variable for the lifetime of the terminal, if you restarted the variable will no longer exist
    - `export PASSWORD=supersecretpassword`

2. Creating a script in the UNIX directory `~/.bashrc`
    - The scripts in this directory are automatically run on startup of the terminal
    - This means you can create the environment variable with the `export` command in a script that gets run every time you start the terminal

## Removing environment variables

If you wanted to get rid of an environment variable you could use the `unset` command
- `unset PASSWORD`

# Package Managers

In Unix based systems if you want to download/install programs/software you will have to use a package manager, there are many pacakage managers based on different distributions including

RPM: The Red Hat package manager, built for RedHat linux, but used in other Distros, manages .rpm packages

APT: Advanced Package Tool is a package manager used on many Linux distributions, allows you to retrieve, configure, and install/uninstall software packages

YUM: Yellowdog updater modifier is a package-management utility for computers running RPM

DPKG: debian package is a low level tool that manages .deb files, it was created for debial and its derivaties
