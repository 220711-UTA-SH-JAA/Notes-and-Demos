# CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets):

sets of key/value pairs, that create rules that define how elements on webpages should look

A CSS rule is composed of selectors and declarations
- Selector is an HTML element or a set of HTML elements
- Declarations are comprised of properties and values surrounded by curly braces

## Three ways of accomplishing styling in CSS

1. Inling CSS, this is CSS applied directlt to an element in the HTML page, using the style attribute
2. Internal/embedded CSS, this is css writeen inside of a `<style>` tag inside of the head of our document
3. External CSS, this is a completely independent file that you import into your html document, this occurs in the head tag
    - use the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` in the head to link the style sheet

# CSS Box Model:

The box model is used to determine how the webpage is rendered by the browser
- Every element in the web page is a series of boxes, that CSS is able to modify

## The four parts of the box model
- Margin: is the outer most retangle
- Border: is the area between the margin and padding
- Passing: is the area between the content and the border
- Content: whatever the element is displaying

# CSS Properties

There are numerous properties that we can adjust to style different elements on our webpage
- border: allows you to change how the border looks
- padding: allows you to change the distance between the content and the border
- margin: allows you to change how much space is between the elements
- display: allows you to change the behavior of how to render the elements
- position: allows you to move the elements where you want them on the page
- color: allows you change the color of the content/element
- background: allows you to change the background
- text-align: allows you to alig text content inside of the element

# CSS Selectors:

used to select specific elements or groups of elements to be styled on the webpage

There are many many ways including:

-   Element selectors: selects by the elements tag (p, h1)
-   Id selector: selects an element by the its id attribute (#id)
-   Class selector: will select a group of elements by the class attribute (.classname)
-   Universal selector: will select all elements on a page (\*)
-   Attribute selector: will select all elements with the specified attribute (\[atribute])
-   Grouping selector: selects multiple elements by their tag, separated by commas
-   Child selector: will select direct children of a specific element (div > p)
-   Descendent selector: will select all of the specified elements nested inside of the parent (div p)
-   General sibling selector: will select sibling elements on the same hierarchy level (div ~ p)
-   Adjacent sibling selector: will select the first sibling of the specified element (div + p)
-   Pseudo class selector: used to specify the state of an element (:visited)
-   Pseudo element selector: used to style parts not specified by the DOM tree (::first-letter)


## Cascading Nature of CSS

In CSS you are allowed to have multiple rules for a single element, in order for the browser to decide which rule to apply there is a style hierarchy which followed known as specificity

This only applies when a single element is targeted by multiple CSS declarations, the order of specificity is as follows:

1. Inline CSS
2. ID selector
3. Class Attribute and Psuedo-Class selectors
4. Element and Psuedo Element Selectors
