# Servlet API

The servlet API provides the interfaces and classes that are needed to build servlets. You can find these classes and interfaces in two packages:

-   java.servlet package - used by servlet or web containers
-   java.servlet.http package - used for handling http requests

The root of the servlet API is the Servlet interface ->

GenericServlet implements Servlet, ServletConfig, Serializable

HttpServlet extends the GenericServlet class, and implements Serializable, this provides us the ability to process HTTP requests with the overriden doGet(), doPost()...

Your CustomServlet extends HttpServlet to override the default implementation for doGet, doPost, etc, to provide the needed functionality for your servlets

# Life cycle of a servlet

There are three main methods of the servlet life cycle

-   init()
-   service()
-   destroy()

The steps of the servlet life cycle:

1. Loading of the Servlet
    - When the application server starts up, the servlet container deploys and loads all of the servlet classes
2. Creating an instance of a servlet
    - Once the servlet classes are loaded, the servlet container creaes a single instance for each servlet class
3. Invoke the init() once
    - Once the servlet classes are instantiated, the init() method is invoked for each instantiated servlet
4. Invoke the service() method for each request received
    - Service determines what type of request was sent from the client (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and calls the corresponging method to process the request and create a response
5. Invoke destroy once
    - This will be called at the end of the servlets life

# Deployment Descriptor

Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to define URL's that map to servlets, and to determine which URL's require authentication

The descriptor file specifies the classes, resources, and configuration and the web service uses them to serve HTTP requests

The descriptor is stored in a file called web.xml, stored in the WEB-INF directory of the project

## Servlet Declarations and Mapping

You must declare and map the servlets in the web.xml of the java application

To Declare the servlet in the `<servlet>`, using `<servlet-name>` and `<servlet-class>` inside of the servlet tag

To map the URL's to the servlet class you use the `<servlet-mapping>` with `<servlet-name>` and `<url-pattern>` inside of the servlet-mapping tag

# HttpServletRequest Object and HttpServletResponse Object

These are objects that get passed into HttpServlet do... methods, they give us access to information inside of the HTTP Request headers and body, as well as allow us to set information to send back to the user

## HttpServletRequest

The Servlet API provides a HttpServletRequest interface which extends the ServletRequest to assist in getting information from a Http Request

This object is the request coming in from the user/client. It can be used to get information out of the body, look at the URI the request was sent to, or even look in the headers for critical information about the request

This object is heavily use in Session management later on

## HttpServletResponse

The Servlet API provides a HttpServletResponse interface which extends the ServletResponse to assist in sending responses to the client

This object represents the HTTP response that the server/web service is going to send back to the user/client

This allows you to send responses, with different types of data, including, HTML, XML, JSON, text and others

Simply set the content type with .setContentType() method, and use a printWriter to write back to the client

# Installation: Tomcat Server

1. Download Apache Tomcat from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
    - Download the core zip

2. Extract it where ever you would like, I just put it in my program files

3. Open up eclipse enterprise edition

4. On the top bar go to `Window` > `Show View` > `Other` > `Server` > `Servers`

5. Click on the check that says `No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server...`

6. In the first window select `Apache` > `Tomcat v9.0 Server` then hit next
    - You can leave the rest of the information default

7. On the Tomcat Server screen, browse for where you stored the unzipped tomcat folder, then hit finish
    - Should look something like `C:Program Files\apache-tomcat-9.0.64`

# Exposing and Consuming RESTful API endpoints (DEMO)

## Writing plain text to response Object

# PostMan

Postman is a very useful application that allows us to send HTTP Requests to servers, and nicely view the HTTP responses sent back

We will be using to manually test our API endpoints, and you will be using it to show the functionality of your P0

It is highly recommended to get very familiar with this tool and all of its features moving forward, because you will be using it a lot

# JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

JSON is a data exchange format that is easily read by humans and computers

String format that represents objects in key value pairs

Syntax:

```json
{
    "key": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}
```
- {} represent an object
- Key: the fields of the object
- Values: the fields values
- [{},{},{}] arrays to send multiple objects

## Why JSON
1. This makes nice and easy for our frontend to convert the objects
2. Our api's are going to be consumed by a client application (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
3. Javascript is virtually the ONLY viable option for a power, popular Client Side Programming

# Serialization via Jackson

The Jackson API is used to convery Java objects into JSON format to send in an HTTP response, and to convert the JSON sent from HTTP requests back into Java objects

Use ObjectMapper.writeValue() method to convert from Java to JSON

Use ObjectMapper.readValue() method to convert from JSON to Java

# Servlet Config and Servlet Context

## ServletConfig
an object created by the Servlet Container, used to pass initial parameters or configurations to a particular servlet

-   Setup inside of the `<servlet>` tags in the web.xml
-   Use the `<init-param>` and next the `<param-name>` and `<param-value>` inside
-   You can get access to these in your java program by using .getServletConfig() method on the HttpServlet class

## SerlvetContext
an object created by the Servlet Container to share initial parameters or configurations to all servlets and other components

-   Use the `<context-param>` tags inside of the webapp tags of the web.xml
-   Inside of the context-param tags you use `<param-name>` and `<param-value>`
-   You can access these parameters by using .getServletContext() method on the HttpServlet class

# Eagerly vs Lazy Loading Servlets

The `<servlet>` element has a subelement called `<load-on-startup>` which is used to make the servlet container load and initialize the servlet as soon as it starts up.

## Eager Loading

when the servlet container loads and initializes servlets when the server starts running

If we mention the `<load-on-startup>` element inside the deployment descriptor, then it will use Eager loading. Otherwise, the default action will be Lazy loading.

The number inside the `<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup> `element tells the servlet container in what *sequence the servlets should be loaded*.

## Lazy Loading

when the servlet container doesn't initialize a servlet as soon as the server starts up, but rather when the first request arrives for it.

## Why lazy load vs eager load?

You can save on resources while you don't need specific servlets active
- Downside is that it may take a little longer the first time you hit that specific endpoint
