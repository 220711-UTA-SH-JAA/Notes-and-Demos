# HTML:

Hypertext Markup Language

- Hypertext refers to the ability to link pages to one another
- Markup refers to the fact that is it NOT a programming language, rather it describes how a webpage should look
- It is the standard for displaying webpages on the internet

HTML uses what are called elements and attributes to create the structure and content of the webpage

# HTML Elements, Tags, and Attributes

## Elements and Tags:

provide the structure of the HTLM document

To create an element you use a tag
- Tags are enclosed with angle brackets <>
- Most elements need an opening and closing tag, the closing tag has a backslash in it `</>`, this indicates the end of the element
- Some tags are self closing, they do not require a closing tag, they include the backslash in the closing tag

## Types of elements

Block-level elements will render their content on a new line by default

Inline elements will render next each other on the same line

## Common HTML Elements:

`<div></div>`:
- This is a block level element denoting a division of the page that typically will hold/group other elements

`<p></p>` (paragraph):
- This is a block level element denoting a block of text

`<span></span>`:
- Allows you to group inline elements

`</br>` (Break line):
- Self closing tag that is block level, and adds a line of whitespace to your webpage

`</img>`(Image tag):
- Self closing inline tag, which allows you to add an image to your webpage

`<h1></h1>` through `<h6></h6>`
- Block level elements denoting a heading text, h1 is the largest, and h6 is the smallest

`<a></a>` (anchor):
- Inline element that is used to create a hyperlink (how we link different HTML pages to one another)

### HTML Tables:

Used in HTML to nicely structure and display data

- `<table>`: creates a table element
- `<thead>`: creates a table row which is a header
- `<tr>`: creates a table row
- `<th>`: creates a header column
- `<tbody>`: specifies the main body of the table
- `<td>`: create a table column
- `<tfoot>`: create a footer row

Using these different table elements and css, old websites used to exclusively use tables for their layouts

### HTML Lists

Used to display a list of items
- `<ol>`: creates an ordered list (numbered list starting at 1)
- `<ul>`: creates an unordered list (bulleted list)
- `<li>`: creates invidual list items inside of the defined list
- You are allowed to have lists inside of lists

## HTML Attributes:

Are key/value pairs that give metadata about the tag that is important for the browser to know

- These are specified inside of the opening tag
- Can be thought of as paremetering defining a specific attribute
- Primarily used for selecting a specified element by said attribute, and either stlying it, or modifying it with Javascript

There are some global attributes that can be applied to all elements/tags in html
- class
- id
- hidden
- lang
- style
- title

There are also tags that have specific attributes
- `<img>` has src and alt
- `<a>` has href

# HTML Doctype and Root Tag

## Doctype:

Every HTML document should begin special tag known as the DOCTYPE declaration
- This lets the browser know what kind of document and version it should be displaying
- We just use `HTML` for HTML 5
    - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- This is the first line of the HTML page

## Root tag:

Every HTML document must also have a root tag `<html></html>`
- The root tag is the html tag

Everything else in the document must go inside of the root tag
- There are two other important tags that go inside of the html tag
- `<head></head>` holds information about the webpage
- `<body></body>` hold the structure/content of our page

# HTML 5

The most recent version of the HTML Markup Language, it introduced the following changes:

- The DOCTYPE declaration
- Character encoding metadata in the head of your document
- The ability to embed audio and video files
- The ability to run JS in the background
- Added new/more semantic tags

## Semantic tags/elements:

Give tags descriptives names, rather than only being for functionality

Tags such as `div`, `p` asnd `span` are non-semantic

Tags such as `table` are semantic tags we already had previous to html 5

HTML 5 introduced these new Semantic tags:

- `<section>`
- `<article>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<nav>`
- `<aside>`
- `<figure>`
- `<figcaption>`
- `<details>`
- `<mark>`
- `<summary>`
- `<time>`

## HTML 5 Audio and Video Tags

HTML also implemented the ability for you to embed audio and video onto your page

## audio tag

Use `<audio>` to embed the audio into your webpage

- `controls` attribute allows you to control the audio straight from the page
- `<source>` element is used to specify the source of the audio
    - `src` attribute to specify where to find the file
    - `type` attribute to specify the audio type
        - MP3, OGG, WAV

## Video tag:

Use `<video>` to embed your video into the webpage
- `width` and `height` attributes to control how large the video is
- `controls` does the same as the above
- `<source>` tag does the same as above
- Supported video types include: MP4, WebM, Ogg

# Form Elements and Its Attributes

Use forms to collect data from users of the website
- Use `<form>` tag to create a new form

The form tag has the following attribute you can set:
- action: the URL to the server you are sending the information
- target: tells the webpage where to load the new page
- method: specifies which http method to use submitting

Inside of the Form Element you can have many inputs for the user to fillout

# Input Elements and Its Attributes

The `<input>` tags inside of the form can have the following attributes
- name: provides a label for that input
- value: allows you to specify a default for that field, and also allows you to get the value typed into that field with JS
- placeholder: allows you to specify some placeholder text for that input
- required: makes it so the user must fill out that field
- min/max: specifies a minimum or maximum value for that field

## Input Types

The input element is used to get information from the user

We have several types of inputs, that allows to get different types of input
- text: one line text input
- password: text field, which does not show the characters
- radio: buttons that only allow one selection per group
- check boxes: buttons that allow multiple selections per groups
- file select: allows the user to input a file
- textarea: a multiline text field
- select: allows a user to select from a dropdown
- reset and sumbit: these do exactly what they say

## Select and Multi-Select

Select is a special input field which allows uses to select values from a drop down box

To use it you use the `<select></select>` tag with nested `<option></option>` tags to display the options of the drop down

There is a special attribute that allows you to let users select multiple values from a select dropdown called `multiple`

Simply add the `multiple` keyword in your select, and it will allow windows users to hold the `ctrl` key to select multiple options and mac users to hold the `command` key to select multiple options

## Submitting Forms

To submit a form you can create an input element of type submit

By default, the form will look at the attributes you set in its opening tag, and send the information inside of it to the url specified

Later on, we will look at a better way of submitting forms with Javascript
