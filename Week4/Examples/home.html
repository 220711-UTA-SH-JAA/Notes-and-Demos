    CSS Cascading Style Sheets
    - A set of key/value pairs, that create rules that define how elements on a webpage look

    A CSS rule is composed of selectors and delcarations
    - Selector will select a specific html element or set of elements
    - Declarations are comprised of properties and values surrounded by curly braces

    Three was of using CSS with HTML
    1. Inline CSS, this is CSS applied directly to an element in an HTML page, using the style attribute
    2. Internal/embedded CSS, this is CSS written inside of a style tag inside the head of your document
    3. External CSS, this is a completely independent file that you import in the head, and you put all of your
        selectors and styles in that file
        - use the <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        - The reason this way is preferred is because you can reuse the same style sheet across multiple pages
    
    CSS Box Model: VERY IMPORTANT

    The box model is used to determine how the webpage is rendered by the browser
    - Every element in the web page is a series of boxes that CSS is able to modify

    There are four boxes in this box model:
    - Margin: is the outer most box
    - Border: is the area between the margin and padding
    - Padding: the area between the content and the border
    - Content: this is the text/image/video/audio content being displayed
