    HTML: HyperText Markup Language
    - Hypertext refers to the ability to link pages to one another
    - Markup refers to the fact that it is not a programming language, rather it is used to
        describe how a webpage should look
    - Is the standard for displaying data on the web

    Html Elements Tags and Attributes

    Element is used to provide structure to the HTML page

    To create elements you use the corresponding tag
    - The tags use angled brackets, with the letter/name of the element
    - Most tags use opening and closing tags, the closing tag also has the name of the element, preceded by a /
        - <tag></tag>
    - Some tags are selfclosing, meaning they don't need a separate closing tag
        - </tag>

    We use these tags to create hierarchies of elements, that will be displayed on a web page
        <tag>
            <tag></tag>
        </tag>
    
    The two types of Elements in HTML:
    - Block level: that will render on a new line by default
    - Inline: will render beside each other on the same line

    The 3/4 elements NEEDED to create an Html page

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    - A special tag which tells the browser what type of document it is displaying
        - Every html document should begin with one of these
        - Adding the html inside of the tag, will specify we are using HTML5
        - This should always be the first line

    <html></html>
    - The html tag is the root of the html document
        - every element making up the html page will go inside of this tag

    <head></head>
    - Gets nested inside of the html tag, and it holds metadata for the browser
        - title on the tab of the browser
        - and seo engine optimizations/keywords

    <body></body>
    - Gets nested inside of the html tags, and it holds the actual structure of your webpage
        - Almost all of your html elements will go in here
-->

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <!-- HTML Tables: allows us to more nicely structure data on the page -->
        <!-- Lets just create a quick nav bar with a table, back in the day, entire website layout were
            formed from tables
        -->
        <!-- To create a table we use the table tag <table><table>
            Inside we can use:
                - <thead>: create a table row which acts as a header
                    - <th>: creates a table header column
                - <tr>: creates a normal table row 
                    -<td>: creates a normal table column
                - <tbody>: creates the "body" of the table
                - <tfoot>: create a footer on the table
        -->
        <!--    HTML Attributes
                Are key/value pairs that give metadata about the tag that is important for the browser to know
                - These will be specified inside of the opening tag of the element
                - Can be thought of as paremeters defining a specific attribute
                - Primarily going to be used to help us select elements from our page with CSS or JS

                Important global attributes you should know
                - class: this applies a class to some elements, they then can be selected as a group
                - id: this should unique, used to select specific element
                - hidden: should this element be seen by the client?
                - lang: what language is the element in?
                - style: for inline css
                - title:

                There are also special attributes for specigic tags:
                - src on the img
                - href on the a
        -->
        <table>
            <thead>
                <!-- Anchor tag: links a html document to another html doument -->
                <th><a>Revature Bank</a></th>
                <th><a href="accounts.html">View Accounts</a></th>
                <th><a href="secretbox.html">Open the Box and Pull the String</a></th>
                <th><a href="login.html">Login</a></th>
            </thead>
        </table>

        <!-- Common HTML elements you will probably see -->
        <!-- div: used a division of the page, these are block level, and are used to group other block
             level elements together -->
        <div>
            <!-- Common text elements -->
            <!-- Headers: <h1></h1> to <h6><h6>-->
            <h1>Welcome to our bank</h1>
            <h3>We are a totally legit business</h3>
            <h6>Don't forget to read the fine print</h6>
