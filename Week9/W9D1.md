# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

AWS EC2 is a service that provides secure, resizeble compute capacity in the cloud. In is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers

An Amazon EC2 Provides:
- A virtual computing environ, (you can host you java appliation here)
- Preconfigured environment templates called AMI (Amazon Machine Images)
    - These contain virtual images of a server, that contains the OS, and software you might want/need for hosting an application
- You can configure the CPU, MEMORY, Storage, etc to be whatever you need
    - The more resources added the more expensize
- It has secure login with ssh keys, and firewalls to prevent unwanted traffic

The firewalls are known as **Security Groups**
- These are set at an instance level, it holds a series of white listed ips we are explicitly allowing

Elastic Block Storage (EBS): provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2's
- If you need extra storage, you can setup, and attach one of these to your EC2

# Scaling an applications

We have two ways of scaling an application, one is vertical, and one horizontal

Vertical Scaling: giving the server the application is running on more resources, more cpu cores, more memory etc

Horizontal Scaling: is spinning up extra servers, and running your application across several resources, with special routing between them

AWS EC2's can use honizontal scaling automatically

## EC2 Autoscaling

Allows you to scale up or down resources for your application automatically to mantain availablity of your application

AWS provides horizontal scaling

## Benefits of Autoscaling:
- Improved Fault Tolerance: detect a fault instance and replace it with a new one
- Increased Application Availablity: insure your application has the right amount of compute power at any given time
- Lower costs: only need to increase the number of instances when you need it, instead of paying the increased number the entired time

## Autoscaling groups
Collections of EC2 instances with similar characterstics
- You can use these to increase the number of instance to improve performance
- You can use these to descreate the number of instances to reduce cost
- You can use these as fixed amounts of instances

Launch configurations allows you to set certain parameters used for autoscaling

Scaling Plans tell how and when to scale, there are three plans
- Scheduled Scaling
- Dynamic Scaling
- Predictive Scaling

More information, and how to set it up can be found here:

# Create an EC2 Instance and SSH into it

1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard and click launch instance
2. Choose an Amazon Machine Image, and select Amazon Linux 2 AMI
3. Choose instance type: select t2 micro for the free tier
4. Skip steps 3-5 until you get to configure security group
5. Configure your security group so that you can access your EC2 from ssh, change source to anywhere
6. Proceed to launch until you are prompted to select an existing key pair or create a new key pair
7. Name you keypair something then click download, then click launch instance
8. Your EC2 has now been launched
9. Go to the EC2 dashboard, choose instances, then choose the instance that you created
10. Click connect then ssh client
11. Open a command prompt window, such as git bash where you have your pem file stored
12. Run the command that is given in the terminal
